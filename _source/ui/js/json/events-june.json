    "description": "In January 2003, at 6:30 am, Robert Weingarten launched his photographic odyssey. Over the course of the year, he made daily exposures at precisely 6:30 am, maintaining an identical combination of camera, 350-millimeter lens, slow-speed film and viewpoint overlooking Santa Monica Bay. Five of his large-scale, luminous photographs of Malibu capture what the artist calls \"the fleeting nature of a particular confluence of light, and conditions that render a moment dramatic and singular.\"Weingarten's photographs engage a long tradition of photographing in sequence, chronicling the way a scene changes from moment to moment, and day to day. The bold, immersive colors also call to mind works of American Expressionist artists, especially Mark Rothko, whose color field paintings have influenced generations of artists. Weingarten reminds us that it is not always necessary to travel to make great photographs, and that sometimes the best art is made close to home.",

    "description": "A native of Kyoto, and known for his unconventional techniques and irreverent humor, Sh\u014dhaku depicts a dragon swooping down through whirls of clouds and mist, and swishing its scaly tail in a rhythmic symphony of rich shades of ink that extends across the thirty-five-foot-long composition. The exhibition commemorates the 55th anniversary of the Kyoto-Boston sister city relationship. When the painting first entered the MFA\u2019s collection in 1911, it was mounted in four sections on thick paper. In recent years, the work was determined to have originally comprised eight paintings on sliding doors (fusuma) that would have been part of a larger set adorning the interior of a Buddhist temple hall. In preparation for its inclusion in a 2012 exhibition of the MFA\u2019s masterpieces in Japan, the paintings were treated by specialists in the Museum\u2019s Asian Conservation Studio. Five years ago they began the process by separating and repairing the damaged paintings, and preparing custom-made wooden lattice cores with multiple layers of paper on each side. The paintings were mounted on these modified fusuma panels and finished with an appropriate lacquer wooden trim. The MFA has long been widely recognized for its unparalleled collection of works by Sh\u014dhaku, including these works on view along with Dragon and Clouds: Hawk (about 1763) and two hanging scrolls by the artist from the late 1770s.Download the Dragons Art Connections card and search for objects and images throughout the Museum to discover how different cultures viewed dragons, and get ideas for art-making activities.

    "description": "Photographers known as the Pictorialists, who worked around 1900, were part of the first international movement in the history of the medium. Their mission was to prove the artistic merit of photography by strengthening its connections with the fine arts. To this end they made images that sought to represent truth and beauty; that were atmospheric; that had poetic, literary, or spiritual value; and that emphasized the role of the photographer as a craftsman. Figures such as Alfred Stieglitz, Edward Steichen, Frederick H. Evans, Alvin Langdon Coburn, Gertrude K\u00e4sebier, and Clarence H. White made spectacular images influenced by current art trends, including Impressionism, Symbolism, and the Arts and Crafts movement.The Pictorialists primarily utilized two printing processes: platinum, with its extraordinary tonal richness, and gum bichromate, a labor-intensive process that involved hand coating papers with carefully prepared emulsions and pigments. They often presented their images by mounting them on papers that were specially lined or colored, like fine art drawings, and they sometimes showed them in specially designed frames.This exhibition celebrates the MFA\u2019s recent acquisition of four major works related to the Boston leader of the movement, F. Holland Day. His The Seven Last Words (1898), purchased in 2013, is a centerpiece of the show and was recently called \u201can important touchstone of Modernist photography,\u201d by The New York Times. Day daringly styled himself in this series as Christ wearing a crown of thorns. The other three photographs\u2014portraits of Day by Edward Steichen, James Craig Annan, and Clarence H. White\u2014are also included. A small number of significant loans from private collections are also on view.Above: F. Holland Day, The Seven Last Words (detail), 1898.

At turns dramatic, contemplative, beautiful and sublime, the sea's mercurial properties captivated Turner and his contemporaries who repeatedly returned to the subject. Iconic Turner masterpieces are exhibited alongside works by other major European and American artists, providing a rich artistic context for Turner's groundbreaking vision.Turner & the Sea was produced by the National Maritime  Museum, part of Royal Museums Greenwich, London.

At PEM Lin spotlights the renowned collection of Asian export art. Lin created a sprawling mural of original armorial and heraldic motifs (elaborate coats of arms) that climb up the walls of the Mellon Staircase and along the floor of the Export Silver Galleries.To animate the history of trade between China and the West, Lin also created a large-scale installation comprised of hundreds of replicas of Mr. Nobody, one of the first representations of a European gentleman in Chinese porcelain. Photographs that document the creation of the replicas in a factory in China are interspersed among 19th-century gouaches from the PEM collection that depict the historic porcelain production process.Generous support for FreePort [No. 005]: Michael Lin provided by Fay Chandler.
