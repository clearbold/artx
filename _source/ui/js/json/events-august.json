    "description": "In January 2003, at 6:30 am, Robert Weingarten launched his photographic odyssey. Over the course of the year, he made daily exposures at precisely 6:30 am, maintaining an identical combination of camera, 350-millimeter lens, slow-speed film and viewpoint overlooking Santa Monica Bay. Five of his large-scale, luminous photographs of Malibu capture what the artist calls \"the fleeting nature of a particular confluence of light, and conditions that render a moment dramatic and singular.\"Weingarten's photographs engage a long tradition of photographing in sequence, chronicling the way a scene changes from moment to moment, and day to day. The bold, immersive colors also call to mind works of American Expressionist artists, especially Mark Rothko, whose color field paintings have influenced generations of artists. Weingarten reminds us that it is not always necessary to travel to make great photographs, and that sometimes the best art is made close to home.",

At turns dramatic, contemplative, beautiful and sublime, the sea's mercurial properties captivated Turner and his contemporaries who repeatedly returned to the subject. Iconic Turner masterpieces are exhibited alongside works by other major European and American artists, providing a rich artistic context for Turner's groundbreaking vision.Turner & the Sea was produced by the National Maritime  Museum, part of Royal Museums Greenwich, London. Supported by an  indemnity from the Federal Council on the Arts and the Humanities.Carolyn and Peter S. Lynch and The Lynch Foundation, and The Manton Foundation provided generous support.The East India Marine Associates of the Peabody Essex Museum also provided support.Media Partners:",

    "description": "Artist Michael Lin began developing a reputation in the late 1990s for painting vast, bold designs on sober architectural settings, interventions that injected a vibrant sense of play. At PEM Lin spotlights the renowned collection of Asian export art. Lin created a sprawling mural of original armorial and heraldic motifs (elaborate coats of arms) that climb up the walls of the Mellon Staircase and along the floor of the Export Silver Galleries.To animate the history of trade between China and the West, Lin also created a large-scale installation comprised of hundreds of replicas of Mr. Nobody, one of the first representations of a European gentleman in Chinese porcelain. Photographs that document the creation of the replicas in a factory in China are interspersed among 19th-century gouaches from the PEM collection that depict the historic porcelain production process.Generous support for FreePort [No. 005]: Michael Lin provided by Fay Chandler. PEM also wishes to thank donors to the 2012 FreePort Fund: Terry and Dick Albright, Jeffrey P. Beale, Mr. Alfred D. Chandler III and The Reverend Susan Esco Chandler.
