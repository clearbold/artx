    "description": "In January 2003, at 6:30 am, Robert Weingarten launched his photographic odyssey. Over the course of the year, he made daily exposures at precisely 6:30 am, maintaining an identical combination of camera, 350-millimeter lens, slow-speed film and viewpoint overlooking Santa Monica Bay. Five of his large-scale, luminous photographs of Malibu capture what the artist calls \"the fleeting nature of a particular confluence of light, and conditions that render a moment dramatic and singular.\"Weingarten's photographs engage a long tradition of photographing in sequence, chronicling the way a scene changes from moment to moment, and day to day. The bold, immersive colors also call to mind works of American Expressionist artists, especially Mark Rothko, whose color field paintings have influenced generations of artists. Weingarten reminds us that it is not always necessary to travel to make great photographs, and that sometimes the best art is made close to home.",

    "description": "Featuring some 40 works, both past and new, 9 Artists includes a range of sculpture, drawing, installation, and video. The exhibition is organized by the Walker Art Center and curated by Bartholomew Ryan; Alise Upitis is the organizing curator for the List. The exhibition recently closed at the Walker Art Center and opens at the List on May 9, 2014.Yael Bartana (b. 1970) is an Israeli artist who lives and works in Berlin. A key theme in Bartana\u2019s work is the investigation and then intervention in the processes by which communities convene, subjects are formed, national mythologies maintained, gendered behaviors enforced. The exhibition will feature her dynamic video trilogy, and Europe will be stunned, which has received considerable international attention since it debuted at the 54th Venice Biennale, where the artist represented the Polish Pavilion. and Europe will be stunned tells the story of the rise of the Jewish Renaissance Movement in Poland, a quasi-fictional political group that calls for the return to that country of 3.3 million Jews. Ultimately, in a European context that has seen a resurgence in nationalism in recent years, the group becomes home to all who feel that citizenship should be organized around more than national, ethnic, or religious identity. Intimately invested in the legacy of modernism, Liam Gillick (b.1964) makes sculptures, text-based works, and publications that owe much to a working through of the failure of its Utopian promise to design a more egalitarian society. The exhibition will present a series of projects from the last 20 years of the artist\u2019s production\u2014from graphic vinyl wall texts, to giant Bloody Mary\u2019s, to glitter carpets. What aligns the work is a concern for organization, how communities exist and are transformed in an era of ever increasing privatization.Natascha Sadr Haghighian abjures biography altogether, for instance she sees the artist r\u00e9sum\u00e9 as a shorthand simplification that rates the individual according to past institutional affiliations, or regulates them according to conventional markers of identity (age, nationality, and so on). In 2004 she created bioswop.net for the free exchange and sharing of r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and biographies. The exhibition will feature key works from the last several years that explore the precariousness of work and life today.Dutch artist Renzo Martens (b. 1973), who lives and works in Brussels and Kinshasa, is known for his satirical and disturbing video documentaries in which he travels to war-torn countries and places himself narcissistically at the center of the action, demonstrating how Western spectators consume distant trauma. For the List, he will present the work of the Institute for Human Activities, an organization he has founded dedicated to the transformation through artist-propelled gentrification of a former Unilever plantation 800 miles north of Kinshasa on the Congo River. New York-based artist Bjarne Melgaard (Norwegian, b. Australia, 1967) has produced a newly commissioned work that dispenses with his usual immersive and expressionistic installations in favor of a photographic memoir of his movements in the work. Disturbing and illuminating, they capture both the figure of the artist in seemingly candid documentation and also many of his works and installations. The cinematic quality of the presentation is accompanied by a new video and soundtrack developed with New York-based artist Marie Karlberg.Artist N\u00e1stio Mosquito\u2019s approach (b. 1981 in Angola, lives and works in Luanda) finds form in his music, performances, and videos, and the exhibition will present a range of moving image works (including a newly commissioned piece) by one of the artists\u2019 alter egos N\u00e1stia, a Russian accented prognosticator, who discourses about the world with a mixture of crude clich\u00e9, insight, and satirical self-help dogma. In a recent work, Mosquito declared, \u201cI do represent, if you are willing, the army of the individuals.\u201d This statement could serve as a guiding motto for every artist included in the exhibition. Their loyalty is to the individual, but not the individual who exists in isolation, rather one who acts within a community, even if this community has yet to be invented. The exhibition features Mosquito\u2019s new video essay, N\u00e1stio Mosquito Answers Ryan Bartholomew produced in association with Vic Pereir\u00f3 and leading out of the artist\u2019s recent performance at the Walker. Since the 1990s, Hito Steyerl (b. 1966) has become one of the leading voices among artists who play with conventional formats of the documentary genre, borrowing from its reputation for objectivity while acknowledging its ongoing history as a means of propaganda and indoctrination. 9 Artists features her latest work How not to be seen. A fucking didactic educational .MOV file, which debuted at the Venice Biennale. The work continues her long meditation on the nature of the image in the digital age. Additionally, the exhibition includes Steyerl\u2019s famous Red Alert (2007), which is composed of three computer monitors with monochromatic red glowing fields with which the artist claims to have reached the logical end of the documentary genre. The work of artist Danh Vo (Danish, b. 1975, Vietnam, lives and works in Basel) can be seen as a philosophy of practice that runs through his many projects, exhibitions, and relationships\u2013a keen attention to art-historical precedence as well as geopolitics and the implications of living in a world that is more imbricated than ever before.  People, objects, history, and various identity formations all become material in his expanding and accumulating oeuvre, producing a profound portrait, not necessarily of himself, but of the complicities and complexities of life today. The exhibition will feature a new presentation of Vo\u2019s recent Guggenheim Museum\/Hugo Boss Prize exhibition, I M U U R 2, based on the personal archive of deceased Lower East Side painter (and founder of the Museum of American Graffiti) Martin Wong that he developed over many years in collaboration with his mother Florence Wong.Each artist has contributed a 16-page artist section exploring some aspect of their broad practice in relation to the exhibition, ranging from meditations on the Trayvon Martin social media campaign, to manifesto-like artist statements, and ghost-written letters between an artist and a dead anti-semitic philosopher.  The book has been produced in collaboration with other artists, writers, and designers, such as Karl Holmqvist, Ph\u00f9ng Vo, Galit Eilat, Vic Pereir\u00f3, Brendan Dugan of An Art Service, Federica Bueti, and others. The contributions are accompanied by a 32-page compendium of works, and a text by curator Bartholomew Ryan that weaves together their various approaches, placing them in the context of broader contemporary art practice. Designed and published by the Walker\u2019s award winning design studio, the catalogue is available through Distributed Art Publishers.9 Artists is organized by the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis.  Major support for the exhibition is provided by the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts. Additional support is generously provided by Lisa and Pat Denzer and Audrey and Zygi Wilf. The exhibition catalogue is made possible by a grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation in support of Walker Art Center publications.

At turns dramatic, contemplative, beautiful and sublime, the sea's mercurial properties captivated Turner and his contemporaries who repeatedly returned to the subject. Iconic Turner masterpieces are exhibited alongside works by other major European and American artists, providing a rich artistic context for Turner's groundbreaking vision.Turner & the Sea was produced by the National Maritime  Museum, part of Royal Museums Greenwich, London.

Lin created a sprawling mural of original armorial and heraldic motifs (elaborate coats of arms) that climb up the walls of the Mellon Staircase and along the floor of the Export Silver Galleries.To animate the history of trade between China and the West, Lin also created a large-scale installation comprised of hundreds of replicas of Mr. Nobody, one of the first representations of a European gentleman in Chinese porcelain. Photographs that document the creation of the replicas in a factory in China are interspersed among 19th-century gouaches from the PEM collection that depict the historic porcelain production process.Generous support for FreePort [No. 005]: Michael Lin provided by Fay Chandler. PEM also wishes to thank donors to the 2012 FreePort Fund: Terry and Dick Albright, Jeffrey P. Beale, Mr. Alfred D. Chandler III and The Reverend Susan Esco Chandler. Additional support provided by Mandarin Oriental, Boston, and the East India Marine Associates of the Peabody Essex Museum.Media Partner",

    "description": "Through delicate works on paper and other select objects, explore four essential motifs Westerners often associate with China -- fish, silk, tea, bamboo. Each was cultivated for artistic expression as well as profit. All helped shape the emerging concept of the Middle Kingdom in 18th-century Europe.
