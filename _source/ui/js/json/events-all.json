    "description": "In their Sculpture Park intervention, 4-Wheeler Rollover, Okay Mountain stages a rebellious joy ride that rips through deCordova\u2019s pristine campus and terminates in an upturned All-Terrain Vehicle (ATV). The eight-member artist collective casts the freewheeling tire treads in tinted concrete, to give permanence to the normally ephemeral tracks, and to place the vehicle in dialogue with the more traditional sculptures that surround it. By deliberately crashing \u201clowbrow\u201d thrillcraft culture into the \u201chighbrow\u201d space of fine art, Okay Mountain orchestrates the kind of witty cultural collision for which they are known.Based in Austin, TX, the artists of Okay Mountain (Carlos Rosales-Silva, Corkey Sinks, Josh Rios, Justin Goldwater, Ryan Hennessee, Nathan Green, Peat Duggins, Michael Sieben, Sterling Allen, Tim Brown), have been working collaboratively since 2006 when they formed an artist-run alternative gallery. Since then, the group has exhibited their installation projects throughout the United States and in Mexico City. Their large-scale sculptural projects blend humor with a big Texan mentality and aesthetic, are rife with art historical references and laced with social critique. With 4-Wheeler Rollover, the art historically savvy artists riff off the long and hallowed tradition of Land Art by taking the Sculpture Park\u2014once the manicured lawn of Julian de Cordova\u2014as their canvas, but revisit this history through the unexpected language of American consumer culture and recreation. The collective carves up the Park with a wink, a nod, and a slight jab at Land Artists like Michael Heizer, who excavated huge trenches and choreographed lyrical motorcycle track drawings in the desert. Their brand of smart, bawdy interventions coyly critique the institutionalization of art and invite us all along for the ride.Okay Mountain has exhibited at Freight + Volume, NY; Austin Museum of Art, TX; Galeria Enrique Guerrero in Mexico City, Mexico; Paragraph in Kansas City, KS; PULSE in Miami,FL; Texas State University in San Marcos, TX; the Creative Research Lab in Austin, TX; Prosect 1.5 in New Orleans, LA; the Blaffer Art Museum, Houston, TX; and McNay Art Museum, San Antonio, TX. While most of the Okay Mountain members are alumni of the University of Texas at Austin, others are graduates of the University of California, Los Angeles; the Rhode Island School of Design; and the University of Kansas.Images \u00a9 Andy Ryan.",

    "description": "Chris Burden, Victoria Falls Bridge, 2003, Stainless steel reproduction Mysto Type I Erector parts, wood base. Photo by Douglas Parker, courtesy of Chris Burden Studio.In his pioneering performances of the 1970s, Los Angeles-based artist Chris Burden (b. 1946) gained a reputation for testing limits: of his own body, and of institutions and publics variously implicated in his provocative actions. Both beautiful and extreme, iconic performances like Shoot (1971), TV Hijack (1972), and Transfixed (1974) forced viewers to confront the most pressing moral and political issues of the day through allegory and metaphor.  Burden considered these early performances live sculptures in space. Beginning in the late-1970s, his interests turned from these live sculpture events and towards the production of permanent three-dimensional objects.  \nCHRIS BURDEN: THE MASTER BUILDER presents a near comprehensive account of Burden\u2019s small-scale Erector set bridges.  Modeled after bridges imagined and real, the artist\u2019s Erector set sculptures extend his work as a social engineer, demonstrating his dual commitment to empirical and symbolic inquiry.  Burden\u2019s bridges are constructed from vintage and reproduced Meccano and Erector parts, perforated metal construction toys first marketed at the start of the 20th century. As part of The Master Builder, Burden is constructing a two-story Erector set skyscraper that will be installed in the museum in April.\nIn addition to this exhibition, the Rose has commissioned Chris Burden to create a permanent, outdoor sculpture for the museum\u2019s front lawn entitled Light of Reason, which will be completed in fall 2014.",

    "description": "Mika Rottenberg, still from Squeeze, 2010, single channel video installation and digital C-print, 20 min. Courtesy the artist and Andrea Rosen Gallery, New York.MIKA ROTTENBERG: BOWLS BALLS SOULS HOLES is Rottenberg\u2019s (b. 1976) first solo museum exhibition in the United States. Conceived in relation to the Rose\u2019s expansive Lois Foster Gallery, the exhibition offers a selective account of the thematic and formal interests that have structured Rottenberg\u2019s development to date. In addition to Squeeze (2010) and Tsss (2013), the Rose will present Rottenberg\u2019s newest video installation, Bowls Balls Souls Holes (2014), a major new work commissioned and funded in part by the museum. \nRottenberg uses the moving image as a device to relate impossibly disparate\u2014and often highly eccentric\u2014characters, places, and activities, collapsing the space between them to produce parallel worlds. The artist\u2019s videos and the sculptural environments that contain them re-imagine space and time to bring fantastical narratives of production and consumption to life, and the resulting installations disorient and transport the viewer to a place where weird and wonderful production lines abide by their own hermetic, relentless logic. Rich in material eccentricity, marginal subjectivities, and narrative absurdity, Mika Rottenberg takes the world we share apart and returns it to us in a form that is as strange and foreign as it is deeply felt and resonant.\nThe exhibition will be accompanied by a monograph on the artist with essays by Christopher Bedford, Julia Bryan-Wilson, and Wayne Koestenbaum.",

Each project series will consist of three exhibitions addressing different aspects of a thematic, scholarly concern. Since the 1970s, \u201cproject\u201d exhibitions in U.S. museums have focused on monographic presentations of young artists in an effort to inject the contemporary into institutional contexts. With the aim of foregrounding curatorial thought and creativity, Rose Projects, by contrast, emphasizes the timeliness of the idea structuring the related projects, marrying careful scholarship to adventurous thinking. Rose Projects 1, organized by Curator at Large Katy Siegel, focuses on artists who refuse the categorical divides between representation and materialist abstraction, image and object, looking instead for different models of reality through paintings that exist on the threshold between the recognizable and the unknown. \nThe first of Siegel\u2019s three exhibitions brings together artists from different historical moments: Wols, born Alfred Otto Wolfgang Schulze (1913\u20131951) and Charline von Heyl (b. 1960). Wols and von Heyl use traditional mediums in non-traditional ways, broadening and reveling in the spectrum of possible colors, surfaces, and images they can produce. For both artists, art has the potential to reveal profound desires and realities that often remain unnoticed, or even invisible.",

The third iteration of Rose Video draws a link between Lassnig\u2019s animation-based films of the early 1970s and the contemporary videos of Reid Kelley, who writes and performs lyrical, pun-filled ballads against a backdrop of black and white drawings. The joint presentation of their work charts a historical trajectory shaped both by a careful attention to craft as well as feminist critique. Lassnig and Reid Kelley build platforms for rethinking the roles held and voices raised by women, ultimately suggesting the power of the artist to rewrite and remake the stories we inherit.\nRose Video 03 will open on March 26, with an opening reception and artist talk on the evening of Tuesday, March 25.",

    "description": "Featuring some 40 works, both past and new, 9 Artists includes a range of sculpture, drawing, installation, and video. The exhibition is organized by the Walker Art Center and curated by Bartholomew Ryan; Alise Upitis is the organizing curator for the List. The exhibition recently closed at the Walker Art Center and opens at the List on May 9, 2014.Yael Bartana (b. 1970) is an Israeli artist who lives and works in Berlin. A key theme in Bartana\u2019s work is the investigation and then intervention in the processes by which communities convene, subjects are formed, national mythologies maintained, gendered behaviors enforced. The exhibition will feature her dynamic video trilogy, and Europe will be stunned, which has received considerable international attention since it debuted at the 54th Venice Biennale, where the artist represented the Polish Pavilion. and Europe will be stunned tells the story of the rise of the Jewish Renaissance Movement in Poland, a quasi-fictional political group that calls for the return to that country of 3.3 million Jews. Ultimately, in a European context that has seen a resurgence in nationalism in recent years, the group becomes home to all who feel that citizenship should be organized around more than national, ethnic, or religious identity. Intimately invested in the legacy of modernism, Liam Gillick (b.1964) makes sculptures, text-based works, and publications that owe much to a working through of the failure of its Utopian promise to design a more egalitarian society. The exhibition will present a series of projects from the last 20 years of the artist\u2019s production\u2014from graphic vinyl wall texts, to giant Bloody Mary\u2019s, to glitter carpets. What aligns the work is a concern for organization, how communities exist and are transformed in an era of ever increasing privatization.Natascha Sadr Haghighian abjures biography altogether, for instance she sees the artist r\u00e9sum\u00e9 as a shorthand simplification that rates the individual according to past institutional affiliations, or regulates them according to conventional markers of identity (age, nationality, and so on). In 2004 she created bioswop.net for the free exchange and sharing of r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and biographies. The exhibition will feature key works from the last several years that explore the precariousness of work and life today.Dutch artist Renzo Martens (b. 1973), who lives and works in Brussels and Kinshasa, is known for his satirical and disturbing video documentaries in which he travels to war-torn countries and places himself narcissistically at the center of the action, demonstrating how Western spectators consume distant trauma. For the List, he will present the work of the Institute for Human Activities, an organization he has founded dedicated to the transformation through artist-propelled gentrification of a former Unilever plantation 800 miles north of Kinshasa on the Congo River. New York-based artist Bjarne Melgaard (Norwegian, b. Australia, 1967) has produced a newly commissioned work that dispenses with his usual immersive and expressionistic installations in favor of a photographic memoir of his movements in the work. Disturbing and illuminating, they capture both the figure of the artist in seemingly candid documentation and also many of his works and installations. The cinematic quality of the presentation is accompanied by a new video and soundtrack developed with New York-based artist Marie Karlberg.Artist N\u00e1stio Mosquito\u2019s approach (b. 1981 in Angola, lives and works in Luanda) finds form in his music, performances, and videos, and the exhibition will present a range of moving image works (including a newly commissioned piece) by one of the artists\u2019 alter egos N\u00e1stia, a Russian accented prognosticator, who discourses about the world with a mixture of crude clich\u00e9, insight, and satirical self-help dogma. In a recent work, Mosquito declared, \u201cI do represent, if you are willing, the army of the individuals.\u201d This statement could serve as a guiding motto for every artist included in the exhibition. Their loyalty is to the individual, but not the individual who exists in isolation, rather one who acts within a community, even if this community has yet to be invented. The exhibition features Mosquito\u2019s new video essay, N\u00e1stio Mosquito Answers Ryan Bartholomew produced in association with Vic Pereir\u00f3 and leading out of the artist\u2019s recent performance at the Walker. Since the 1990s, Hito Steyerl (b. 1966) has become one of the leading voices among artists who play with conventional formats of the documentary genre, borrowing from its reputation for objectivity while acknowledging its ongoing history as a means of propaganda and indoctrination. 9 Artists features her latest work How not to be seen. A fucking didactic educational .MOV file, which debuted at the Venice Biennale. The work continues her long meditation on the nature of the image in the digital age. Additionally, the exhibition includes Steyerl\u2019s famous Red Alert (2007), which is composed of three computer monitors with monochromatic red glowing fields with which the artist claims to have reached the logical end of the documentary genre. The work of artist Danh Vo (Danish, b. 1975, Vietnam, lives and works in Basel) can be seen as a philosophy of practice that runs through his many projects, exhibitions, and relationships\u2013a keen attention to art-historical precedence as well as geopolitics and the implications of living in a world that is more imbricated than ever before.  People, objects, history, and various identity formations all become material in his expanding and accumulating oeuvre, producing a profound portrait, not necessarily of himself, but of the complicities and complexities of life today. The exhibition will feature a new presentation of Vo\u2019s recent Guggenheim Museum\/Hugo Boss Prize exhibition, I M U U R 2, based on the personal archive of deceased Lower East Side painter (and founder of the Museum of American Graffiti) Martin Wong that he developed over many years in collaboration with his mother Florence Wong.Each artist has contributed a 16-page artist section exploring some aspect of their broad practice in relation to the exhibition, ranging from meditations on the Trayvon Martin social media campaign, to manifesto-like artist statements, and ghost-written letters between an artist and a dead anti-semitic philosopher.  The book has been produced in collaboration with other artists, writers, and designers, such as Karl Holmqvist, Ph\u00f9ng Vo, Galit Eilat, Vic Pereir\u00f3, Brendan Dugan of An Art Service, Federica Bueti, and others. The contributions are accompanied by a 32-page compendium of works, and a text by curator Bartholomew Ryan that weaves together their various approaches, placing them in the context of broader contemporary art practice. Designed and published by the Walker\u2019s award winning design studio, the catalogue is available through Distributed Art Publishers.9 Artists is organized by the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis.  Major support for the exhibition is provided by the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts. Additional support is generously provided by Lisa and Pat Denzer and Audrey and Zygi Wilf.

    "description": "A native of Kyoto, and known for his unconventional techniques and irreverent humor, Sh\u014dhaku depicts a dragon swooping down through whirls of clouds and mist, and swishing its scaly tail in a rhythmic symphony of rich shades of ink that extends across the thirty-five-foot-long composition. The exhibition commemorates the 55th anniversary of the Kyoto-Boston sister city relationship. When the painting first entered the MFA\u2019s collection in 1911, it was mounted in four sections on thick paper. In recent years, the work was determined to have originally comprised eight paintings on sliding doors (fusuma) that would have been part of a larger set adorning the interior of a Buddhist temple hall. In preparation for its inclusion in a 2012 exhibition of the MFA\u2019s masterpieces in Japan, the paintings were treated by specialists in the Museum\u2019s Asian Conservation Studio. Five years ago they began the process by separating and repairing the damaged paintings, and preparing custom-made wooden lattice cores with multiple layers of paper on each side. The paintings were mounted on these modified fusuma panels and finished with an appropriate lacquer wooden trim. The MFA has long been widely recognized for its unparalleled collection of works by Sh\u014dhaku, including these works on view along with Dragon and Clouds: Hawk (about 1763) and two hanging scrolls by the artist from the late 1770s.Download the Dragons Art Connections card and search for objects and images throughout the Museum to discover how different cultures viewed dragons, and get ideas for art-making activities.

    "description": "Photographers known as the Pictorialists, who worked around 1900, were part of the first international movement in the history of the medium. Their mission was to prove the artistic merit of photography by strengthening its connections with the fine arts. To this end they made images that sought to represent truth and beauty; that were atmospheric; that had poetic, literary, or spiritual value; and that emphasized the role of the photographer as a craftsman. Figures such as Alfred Stieglitz, Edward Steichen, Frederick H. Evans, Alvin Langdon Coburn, Gertrude K\u00e4sebier, and Clarence H. White made spectacular images influenced by current art trends, including Impressionism, Symbolism, and the Arts and Crafts movement.The Pictorialists primarily utilized two printing processes: platinum, with its extraordinary tonal richness, and gum bichromate, a labor-intensive process that involved hand coating papers with carefully prepared emulsions and pigments. They often presented their images by mounting them on papers that were specially lined or colored, like fine art drawings, and they sometimes showed them in specially designed frames.This exhibition celebrates the MFA\u2019s recent acquisition of four major works related to the Boston leader of the movement, F. Holland Day. His The Seven Last Words (1898), purchased in 2013, is a centerpiece of the show and was recently called \u201can important touchstone of Modernist photography,\u201d by The New York Times. Day daringly styled himself in this series as Christ wearing a crown of thorns. The other three photographs\u2014portraits of Day by Edward Steichen, James Craig Annan, and Clarence H. White\u2014are also included. A small number of significant loans from private collections are also on view.Above: F. Holland Day, The Seven Last Words (detail), 1898. Photographs, seven platinum prints in original frame. Barbara M. Marshall Fund, Frank B. Bemis Fund, Otis Norcross Fund, William E.

At turns dramatic, contemplative, beautiful and sublime, the sea's mercurial properties captivated Turner and his contemporaries who repeatedly returned to the subject. Iconic Turner masterpieces are exhibited alongside works by other major European and American artists, providing a rich artistic context for Turner's groundbreaking vision.Turner & the Sea was produced by the National Maritime  Museum, part of Royal Museums Greenwich, London. Supported by an  indemnity from the Federal Council on the Arts and the Humanities.Carolyn and Peter S.

    "description": "In January 2003, at 6:30 am, Robert Weingarten launched his photographic odyssey. Over the course of the year, he made daily exposures at precisely 6:30 am, maintaining an identical combination of camera, 350-millimeter lens, slow-speed film and viewpoint overlooking Santa Monica Bay. Five of his large-scale, luminous photographs of Malibu capture what the artist calls \"the fleeting nature of a particular confluence of light, and conditions that render a moment dramatic and singular.\"Weingarten's photographs engage a long tradition of photographing in sequence, chronicling the way a scene changes from moment to moment, and day to day. The bold, immersive colors also call to mind works of American Expressionist artists, especially Mark Rothko, whose color field paintings have influenced generations of artists. Weingarten reminds us that it is not always necessary to travel to make great photographs, and that sometimes the best art is made close to home.",

At PEM Lin spotlights the renowned collection of Asian export art. Lin created a sprawling mural of original armorial and heraldic motifs (elaborate coats of arms) that climb up the walls of the Mellon Staircase and along the floor of the Export Silver Galleries.To animate the history of trade between China and the West, Lin also created a large-scale installation comprised of hundreds of replicas of Mr. Nobody, one of the first representations of a European gentleman in Chinese porcelain. Photographs that document the creation of the replicas in a factory in China are interspersed among 19th-century gouaches from the PEM collection that depict the historic porcelain production process.Generous support for FreePort [No. 005]: Michael Lin provided by Fay Chandler.

    "description": "Carla Fern\u00e1ndez: The Barefoot Designer: A Passion for Radical Design and Community will explore the traditions and techniques of indigenous Mexican artisans and how they can be applied to modern fashion and styles.Carla Fern\u00e1ndez has gained international recognition for her  extraordinary approach to documenting and preserving the rich textile heritage of Mexico's indigenous communities by  transforming it into beautiful contemporary clothing, and proving tradition is anything but static.This first-ever fashion exhibition at the Gardner Museum explores the development of a new language in visual design that Fern\u00e1ndez has built over two decades. She uses a method called \"the Square Root\" based on  the Mexican tradition of making clothing from squares and rectangles. This process emphasizes forms of fabric  and delicate, thoughtful construction based on whole fabric, as opposed to cutting in curves and molding to  the body.The Barefoot Designer is multi-faceted exhibition consisting of garments, textiles, drawings, photographs, performance, video,  workshops and source materials demonstrating Fern\u00e1ndez's multi-layered design process. A key component of that process is her design workshop Taller Flora, a mobile laboratory that collaborates with Mexico's indigenous communities, a sustainable business model based on close collaboration with and recognition of local knowledge and talent. During her  career, Fern\u00e1ndez has worked with many indigenous communities throughout Mexico. The exhibition will highlight the styles and techniques of five states: Chiapas, Yucatan, Campeche, the State of Mexico and Mexico City.Mobility and collaboration can be seen and felt throughout the exhibition: in its installation, multiple films and monthly dance  performances, as well as workshops for the public. The garments and mannequins are positioned on life-sized, mobile  displays. Fern\u00e1ndez has also activated the garments through a live and filmed dance performance by dancers Raushan Mitchell  and Silas Reiner, bringing to life the notion of \"clothing as canvas.\" The exhibition will include short process videos of weavers, embroiderers, and carpenters by photographer and filmmaker Ramiro Chaves, as well as fashion films produced by Chaves and Pedro Torres in New York City, Boston and Mexico City. A series of fashion photos by photographer Graciela Iturbide will be on view. A large workshop table adds a hands-on visitor experience to the exhibition, with a variety of workshops scheduled. Fern\u00e1ndez will run a two-day clothing workshop as well as workshops with the Gardner's School and  Community Partnership Programs.\"I want people to understand that you can find happiness many different ways, and one way is by creating goods by hand and making things unique to the artist,\" Fern\u00e1ndez said. \"Discovering the process helps people to understand how these different worlds work, because you fall in love with the artisan, and then you fall in love with the piece. You can create a whole economy  based on the artists, and how their work is made.\"Learn more about Carla Ferna\u0301ndez's residency at the Gardner Museum.Carla Ferna\u0301ndez: The Barefoot Designer: A Passion for Radical Design and Community is made possible with generous support from The Coby Foundation, Ltd. and the National Endowment for the Arts, with additional assistance from the Consulate General of Mexico in Boston.

    "description": "Hamra Abbas\u2019s art installation on the front of the Gardner Museum shows the spectacular silk and gold curtain (kiswa) that covers the door of the Kaaba in Mecca, Islam\u2019s holiest and most venerated site. The artist was inspired by a small plaster cast of this object displayed in her mother\u2019s house in Lahore, Pakistan. Creating a version of this quintessential Islamic image for her adopted city of Boston, the artist seeks to diffuse the prevailing tension between East and West by bringing visitors in contact with the unfamiliar through visual art.\"Last summer,\" Abbas says, \"I found this cheap plaster imitation of the Kaaba door in my mother's house in Lahore. It was hanging askew with a sizable layer of dust, which is not surprising for my mom, where chaos takes another meaning all together. However, it made me take notice of similar happenings in other places, while visiting friends and family and during my interaction with people in public spaces, so eventually I started documenting them. For me these small imperfections reveal the human element that co-exists with the seemingly monolithic ideals of truth and perfection.\"Abbas is the third artist invited to create site-specific work for the Gardner fa\u00e7ade. The space is devoted to new work by Gardner Museum Artists-in-Residence and changes about every six months. Abbas came to the Gardner as an Artist-in-Residence in 2011.Hamra Abbas's residency at the Gardner Museum was supported in part by The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts.

    "name": "Ian Hamilton Finlay: Arcadian Revolutionary and Avant-Gardener",
    "url": "http:\/\/www.decordova.org\/art\/exhibition\/ian-hamilton-finlay",
    "description": "This ambitious survey exhibition of the work of the internationally renowned Scottish artist, poet, and garden designer Ian Hamilton Finlay showcases over 200 objects including sculptures, prints, and books. The show is the first museum exhibition of the artist\u2019s work in the United States since his show at the Philadelphia Museum of Art in 1992; the exhibition is also the first of the artist\u2019s work in the United States since his death in 2006. In addition to filling deCordova\u2019s Linde and Foster Galleries, the exhibition contains a number of works installed outdoors in the Sculpture Park.After founding Wild Hawthorn Press in 1961 and publishing hundreds of artists\u2019 books, Finlay rose to prominence as one of Great Britain\u2019s foremost experimental literary artists making concrete poetry, a practice which wed language with sculptural form. In 1966, he and his wife Sue Finlay built Little Sparta, a garden in Dunsyre, Scotland, which became the site for the ultimate realization of his aesthetic program. Finlay treated Little Sparta as a site for engaging with cultural inquiry and criticism rather than as a sanctuary or more traditional pastoral setting; he literally placed language into the landscape in monumental form, encouraging a discourse on the reconciliation between nature and modern society.Finlay freely mined human history to source imagery for his work. He believed that most positive symbols in Western culture had been drained of their meaning through consumerist assimilation and desensitization, and so employed universally powerful symbols of violence and authority such as machine guns, tanks, and guillotines in his work. Finlay\u2019s merger of beauty, violence, and the sacred spoke to his belief in the disintegration of contemporary society\u2019s cultural ideals. When encountered in juxtaposition to emblems of nature and classical idealism, Finlay\u2019s epigrams provoke contemplation of society\u2019s need for a reclamation of civic and aesthetic values.Several works demonstrating Finlay\u2019s signature fusion of classical beauty and violence are on view in deCordova\u2019s exhibition. Apollo\/Saint Just after Bernini (1985-2003) is a suite of bronze sculptures of the youthful Olympian deity, each equipped\u2013upon closer inspection\u2013with modern weapons such as hand grenades and submachine guns, rather than flutes or harps. Similarly, Finlay\u2019s Aphrodite de la Terreur (Aphrodite of the Terror) (1987) is a plaster sculpture of the Greek goddess of love, beauty, and sexuality\u2013this time adorned with a modest red necklace, a chilling reference to the red string worn around the necks of mourning relatives of the beheaded during the French Revolution.Finlay\u2019s work often commands attention through his simple visual and verbal plays on language: Wildflower Vase (1985) is an ephemeral bouquet in a classical white vase labeled with the text \"Wildflower: A Mean Term between Revolution and Virtue.\" Finlay\u2019s text causes the work\u2019s immediate beauty and representation of nature to become a prompt for the contemplation of communal mindfulness. In a comparable gesture, Finlay\u2019s Panzer Leader (1976) is a cast tortoise whose shell is embossed with the word Panzer, a German word that can be translated as tank, armor, or turtle shell. Although Panzer Leader appears to be an unassuming, tank-like reptile at first glance, Finlay\u2019s application of language quickly renders it a more sinister evocation of the thunderous crush of German tanks during World War II.Finlay\u2019s challenging engagement with landscape and history does not make allowance for a passive viewing experience. The artist\u2019s work encourages viewers to question the role of the detached consumer and to utilize the tools of awareness that Finlay presents in his work in order to consider their responsibility in articulating the future of society.Funding for this exhibition has been provided by an anonymous donor and Joyce Linde.Ian Hamilton Finlay was born to Scottish parents in the Bahamas in 1926, and his family returned to Glasgow when he was a child. Although his formal education ended with the outbreak of World War II, Finlay began to write short stories and play while working as a shepherd during his early adulthood. He rose to prominence as one of Great Britain\u2019s foremost experimental literary artists after founding Wild Hawthorn Press in 1961, through which he published hundreds of artists\u2019 books. Finlay died in 2006 in Edinburgh, Scotland.Today, Finlay is regarded as one of the most influential British artists of the twentieth century for his work as sculptor, poet, and landscape designer. Finlay\u2019s work has been exhibited internationally, including solo exhibitions at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Tate Gallery, London, England; and the Wadsworth Athenaeum, Hartford, Connecticut. In addition to being collected by numerous institutions, his work has also been permanently installed in public and private outdoor spaces throughout Europe and North America. Together with his wife, Sue Finlay, the artist created Little Sparta, a vast garden at Stonypath in Dunsyre, Scotland, which blends landscape, sculpture, and language, and currently contains nearly 300 examples of the artist\u2019s work.Lunch and Tour with a Curator: for Members\n\tThursday, July 10, 11 am\u20131 pm\n\tJoin fellow Members for an exclusive tour and lunch with Chief Curator Jennifer Gross.

    "description": "The Gardner Museum recently commissioned Michael Van Valkenburgh to design a new four-season garden on the site of what Isabella Gardner called her \u201cMonk\u2019s Garden.\u201d The redesigned Monk\u2019s Garden, sited to the east of the historic palace, opened in September 2013 as part of the Museum\u2019s expanded campus. CORRESPONDENCE features design process and construction drawings of the new garden, as well as communications between the design team and contractors responsible for its construction. The exhibition centers on a pair of letters between Museum director Anne Hawley and Van Valkenburgh describing their aspirations for the new garden at the beginning of the design process. The exhibition also presents photographs that illustrate how greatly the garden has changed over the years.Van Valkenburgh\u2019s design of the Monk\u2019s Garden interprets the Museum\u2019s meandering gallery layout, and the rich colors and textures of its idiosyncratic collection, in a contemporary landscape context. While the garden is accessible (weather permitting) from both the original Museum building and Renzo Piano\u2019s new addition, it is not the primary connection between them, freeing it to focus instead on cultivating a sense of place. The garden is given its own interior, with the aim of provoking extended quiet contemplation rather than hurried passage.The original high brick wall of Fenway Court surrounds the garden, and the design aims to soften this enclosure through the creation of a small-scale, dreamlike woodland. Composed of approximately 60 trees including stewartia, paper bark maple, and gray birch, the groves establish a detail-rich palette of colors and textures suitable for intimate appreciation. Winding paths, paved in a striking combination of black brick and reflective mica schist, meander through the trees. Rather than intersecting, the paths playfully meet and diverge, while also gently widening in places to create nooks for garden chairs. Please join us in the new garden.",

    "description": "James Surls is an internationally renowned American sculptor whose work uses industrial materials to speak to the undeniable beauty of the natural world. In his abstract creations, Surls plays with dueling themes of nature and industrialization, and explores how materials such as bronze, plastic, and steel can be manipulated into an expression of humanity. Raised in rural Texas, Surls developed an interest in the complex relationship between nature and machinery while working on oil industry pipelines, a bond that inspires much of his sculpture.In Walking Flower Times the Power of Five, Surls employs his recurring motif of a beautiful flower to represent the softer, more majestic side of human nature while contrasting it with the hardness of the wheel-like botanical\u2019s bare branches. The result is a surreal flower that seems as though it is breathing and alive and could walk or roll away at a moment\u2019s notice. Though made of steel, Surls\u2019 sculpture has an organic quality that appears simultaneously earthly and otherworldly.The title, Walking Flower Times the Power of Five, reminds us of the science in nature and the presence of numerical permutations in our everyday surroundings. The sculpture has a core of five arms whose branches double and then quadruple until there are a total of one hundred arms. With every extension yielding a factor of five, Surls allows the viewer to see the logic that is omnipresent in the chaotic beauty of nature.James Surls received a BS from Sam Houston State College and a MFA from Cranbrook Academy of Art. He taught at Southern Methodist University and the University of Houston until 1982. In 1979, he helped to establish the Lawndale Art and Performance Center in Houston, a space for local artists to expose a wider audience to contemporary art. In the midst of Lawndale and his teaching career, Surls moved to Splendora, Texas which marked the beginning of a twenty year period of intense artistic productivity. His retrospective: James Surls: The Splendora Years; 1977-1997 came to deCordova in 2006.  Walking Flower Times the Power of Five was displayed in 2012 on the Rose F. Kennedy Greenway in the center of downtown Boston and was also exhibited in 2009 for the Art in the Parks Program on Park Avenue in New York City.",

    "description": "\u201cQuilts and Color\u201d celebrates the vibrant color palette and inventive design seen in the acclaimed Pilgrim\/Roy Quilt Collection. The exhibition features nearly 60 distinctive quilts from the renowned collection and is the first to explore how, over five decades, trained artists Paul Pilgrim and Gerald Roy searched out and collected quilts with bold, eye-popping designs that echoed the work of mid-20th century Abstract Expressionist and Op Artists.The exhibition opens with the vividly colored quilts that first drew the collectors\u2019 attention and began their life-long passion. Exploring sophisticated principles of color theory, the exhibition\u2019s opening sections display color vibrations, mixtures, gradations, and harmonies in the design of the quilts ranging from the 19th to early 20th century. As their collection grew, Pilgrim and Roy turned their interest to the history of quilting and added more traditional designs. Many of these incorporated the color white to create high contrast. The exhibition\u2019s sections\u2014\u201cVariations\u201d and \u201cOptical Illusions\u201d\u2014examine the effect of color and pattern, highlighting dramatic color choices and innovative effects created within established quilt patterns. The exhibition concludes with a final nod to the artistic vision of quilt makers and highlights artists who worked outside of standard patterns and design.Above: Double Wedding Ring Quilt, about 1940.

Their goal was to infuse their medium with a fresh and distinctly \u201cmodern\u201d style. Influenced by Cubism, Constructivism, Dadaism, and Surrealism, and reflecting the effects that technology, urbanization, and cinema were having on their time, European photographers adopted unconventional and innovative approaches to their image making. Characteristics of their visions include rigorous objectivity, surprising camera angles, and darkroom experimentation. \u201cPhoto Eye: Avant-Garde Photography in Europe\u201d charts this shift through the work of artists such as Constantin Brancusi, Ilse Bing, Andr\u00e9 Kert\u00e9sz, Man Ray, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moholy-Nagy, and Josef Sudek. Their contributions and those of their peers were central to a transformation in photographic expression in the 20th century.

Featuring sculpture, painting, photography, video, installation, and performance art from 1960 to the present, the exhibition explores how avant-garde artists from the Caribbean and Central and South America have become integral to discourses on international contemporary art after years of exclusion from institutions at home and abroad. Four thematic sections\u2014Power Parodied, Borders Redefined, Occupied Geometries, and Absence Accumulated\u2014consider distinct aesthetic strategies that resonate within the artists\u2019 cultural contexts and beyond. Their unique visual languages subvert status quo, defy boundaries, humanize art's abstractions, and revisit forgotten histories. Together they offer critical understandings of what it means to be global today. Developed in collaboration with CIFO, the exhibition will be shown in both Boston and Miami (opens December 4, 2013, for Art Basel Miami Beach) with specially commissioned performances and related installations by internationally acclaimed artists.Learn more in the fully illustrated exhibition catalogue, available for purchase in the MFA Bookstore and Shop and online.Above: Daniel Medina, Reja Naranja (Dispositivo Cin\u00e9tico-Social) \/ Orange Bars (Social-Kinetic Device), 2012.

The students created multiple stop-motion animations about familiar places and people using drawing, flip-books, claymation, and paper cutouts. Each animation project stemmed from an exploration of the MFA's collection and allowed each clubhouse to reflect on and represent the people and places important to their communities. Students were introduced to new and unique art-making materials and skills, while also learning about the Museum's collection and the wider world of video art. The project created a fun and interactive environment where the participating students learned, experimented, and bonded with their peers, families, and communities.The animated films (looping on monitors) and the artwork made to create them (drawings, flip-books, clay sculptures, paper cutouts) are displayed in the final Museum exhibition.The exhibition includes the work of approximately 100 children representing the five Boston Boys & Girls Clubs, West End House Boys & Girls Club of Allston-Brighton, Boston Chinatown Neighborhood Center, and United South End Settlements.Above: Artwork created by Azeb Fikru from United South End Settlements.The Community Arts Initiative is generously supported by the Linde Family Foundation.The Community Arts Initiative is generously supported by the Linde Family Foundation.",

Rydz explores America's coasts, photographing the manufactured remnants of modern life that wash up on the shoreline. Plastic's resilience is exactly the quality that makes it valuable to us, but what we use, discard, and dump in the sea is useless to marine life. Materials that never decay become a permanent part of the oceanic ecosystem. Nature's attempt to reclaim these cast-offs fascinates Rydz, who draws our attention to their transformation on their long journey along the global ocean current, and to the larger implications of society's everyday actions. This exhibition is the first to include Rydz's bold photographs, which, combined with her delicate drawings, depict these fragments in surprising ways.Prior to receiving the SMFA\u2019s prestigious Traveling Scholars Fellowship, Rydz\u2019s research focused on the Atlantic. The fellowship presented her with the opportunity to explore the Pacific and see for herself the nexus of marine debris: Kamilo Point, Hawaii. She explains, \u201cI walked for days through massive amounts of debris and plastic sands feeling like an archaeologist excavating the residues of contemporary history.\u201dAbove: Evelyn Rydz, Postcards from Kamilo (Coral and Bottle Cap), 2013\u201314.

    "description": "In the 20th century, printmaking in Japan became not just a way of producing popular images but a fine art form. No longer constrained by the requirements of commercial publishing, artists were able to exploit the color woodblock process as far as their imaginations could take them, and to experiment with new Western media as well.This exhibition showcases the MFA\u2019s holdings in the area of 20th-century Japanese prints, including both shin hanga made by the traditional collaborative method and s\u014dsaku hanga produced by a single artist working alone. Prints are shown along with preliminary drawings, woodblocks, artists\u2019 proofs, and variant versions printed from the same blocks, highlighting the interplay of creativity and technique in printmaking.A variety of materials, from Takei Takeo\u2019s miniature artist books to large collaborative prints, gives visitors an intriguing behind-the-scenes look at the work of modern Japanese print artists.The exhibition\u2019s centerpiece is the complete set of the six large prints entitled Sailboats (1926) by Yoshida Hiroshi. This iconic work, probably the single best-known example of shin hanga, collaborative method, uses the same woodblocks printed in six different color schemes to show the boats at different times of day; the printing is so skillful that works from this series are sometimes mistaken for watercolors.Above: Yoshida Hiroshi, Sailboats: Morning, from the series Inland Sea, Taisho era\u2013Showa era, 1926.

    "description": "During the last decade, the exciting shapes and technical finesse in Japanese contemporary ceramics and baskets have attracted new audiences among Western enthusiasts. Recently attention has centered on more abstract works produced by modern ceramic and bamboo artists, including pioneering female ceramists, who, beginning in the 1950s, turned to abstract sculpture or architecture for their inspiration, creating innovative, expressive sculptural pieces rooted in traditional materials and techniques but that transcend utilitarian forms. \u201cFired Earth, Woven Bamboo\u201d celebrates contemporary Japanese decorative arts at the MFA, thanks to the recent gift of works spanning the late 20th and early 21st centuries from Stanley and Mary Ann Snider. More than 60 dramatic ceramics and baskets from the Snider Collection are complemented by contemporary Japanese quilts and fabric screens and an example of sophisticated paper sculpture, highlighting the revolution in these traditional media in creative abstraction.Above: Sakurai Yasuko, Vertical Flower, Heisei era, 2007.

    "description": "Tcherepnin\u2019s sound recordings, emanating from a floor built above the List\u2019s existing Bakalar Gallery floor, become a physical music: through transducers, Tcherepnin\u2019s composition transforms the floor itself into a vibrating speaker. Sound is sensed through one\u2019s bone, skin, and body-mass as much as through one\u2019s auditory or visual system, and the body becomes a reservoir of potentials for different patterns of listening. In turn, the gallery itself becomes a space of overlapping physiological registers: the floor becomes a \u201cbone\u201d that speaks in tones, thumps, and grumbles, its voice transmitted not through the air but directly from floor to human, from \u201cbone to bone\u201d; fabric elements become skins that mediate sound in different ways; and metal forms derived from the shape of the tongue and mouth emerge from the floor and walls. These forms are physical sound systems that speak, characters that at times invite, at times rebuff, interaction, with each state a point of departure for other sounds and trajectories of listening. By creating an order of coexistence and succession that opens up a logic of the senses, Tcherepnin\u2019s work looks to how both things and bodies can be constituted through sound.About the ArtistSergei Tcherepnin was born in Boston in 1981, and currently lives and works in New York. He received a BFA from Bard College and subsequently received his MFA from the Milton Avery Graduate School of the Arts, Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, New York in 2011. His recent performances and installations include: Roulette, New York; The Museum of Modern Art, New York; Pavilion of Georgia at the 55th Venice Biennale; Murray Guy, NY; The Kitchen, NY; Yvon Lambert, Paris; Karma International, Zurich; Guggenheim Museum, NY; and the 30th S\u00e3o Paulo Biennial, Brazil. He is participating in the 2014 Whitney Biennial and is a recipient of 2014 Villa Romana Fellowship in Florence, Italy.
