                        <p>A featured artist in the ICA&rsquo;s collection, Jason Middlebrook commonly uses organic motifs and materials to explore the relationship between nature and culture. Join him for this special introduction to his creative process, tools, and materials; working with wood planks provided by the artist, participants will prepare works to take home at a later date. All skill levels welcome.</p>
