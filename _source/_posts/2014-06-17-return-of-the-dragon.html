    native of Kyoto, and known for his unconventional techniques and irreverent humor,
    Shhaku depicts a dragon swooping down through whirls of clouds and mist, and swishing
    its scaly tail in a rhythmic symphony of rich shades of ink that extends across
    the thirty-five-foot-long composition. The exhibition commemorates the 55th anniversary
    of the Kyoto-Boston sister city relationship. When the painting first entered
    the MFAs collection in 1911, it was mounted in four sections on thick paper. In
    recent years, the work was determined to have originally comprised eight paintings
    on sliding doors (fusuma) that would have been part of a larger set adorning the
    interior of a Buddhist temple hall. In preparation for its inclusion in a 2012
    exhibition of the MFAs masterpieces in Japan, the paintings were treated by specialists
    in the Museums Asian Conservation Studio. Five years ago they began the process
    by separating and repairing the damaged paintings, and preparing custom-made wooden
    lattice cores with multiple layers of paper on each side. The paintings were mounted
    on these modified fusuma panels and finished with an appropriate lacquer wooden
    trim. The MFA has long been widely recognized for its unparalleled collection
    of works by Shhaku, including these works on view along with Dragon and Clouds:
    Hawk (about 1763) and two hanging scrolls by the artist from the late 1770s.Download
