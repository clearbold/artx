    exhibition features over 500 framed prints and photographs by leading modern and
    contemporary artists, including Andy Warhol, Louise Bourgeois, Alex Katz, Cindy
    Sherman, Sol LeWitt, and Fred Wilson.Although only MIT students can borrow art,
    the exhibition is free and open to the public. As MIT List Visual Arts Center
    director Paul C. Ha states, One of the Lists important ongoing annual programs
    is our Student Loan Art Program. It is where MIT students participate in caring
    for and living with art, experiencing first hand what it is to be a contemporary
    art collector. The List is proud to host this program as it continues to grow
    in participation and in collection.Results of the lottery will be posted by 6
    pm on September 9. If you are selected to receive an artwork or are selected as
    an alternate, you will be notified by email; in addition, results will be posted
    on our gallery doors.Students who do not receive art through the lottery have
    another opportunity to borrow one of these pieces. Artworks that are not claimed
    by the end of the day on September 11 are distributed to students during Last
    Chance Pick-Up on Friday, September 12, where remaining artworks can be selected
    on a first come, first served basis.', !!python/unicode 'id': '30', !!python/unicode 'image': 'http://listart.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/slideshow/public/DSC_4295.JPG?itok=v3qb4qQG',
