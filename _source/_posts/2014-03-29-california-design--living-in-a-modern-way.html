description: 'More than 250 examples of midcentury modern design reveal the distinctive
  role California had in shaping material culture from 1930-1965. Featuring a diverse
  array of furniture, textiles, fashion, industrial and graphic design, ceramics,
  jewelry, metalwork, film and architecture, this exhibition celebrates the innovation
  and pervasiveness of midcentury modern design. The work of legendary designers such
  as Charles and Ray Eames, Richard Neutra, and Greta Magnusson Grossman are explored,
  as is the sociological and geographical context which gave rise to this unprecedented
  design movement. Organized by the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA), this
  exhibition is the first major study of California midcentury modern design.Support
  provided by the East India Marine Associates of the Peabody Essex Museum.Broadcast
