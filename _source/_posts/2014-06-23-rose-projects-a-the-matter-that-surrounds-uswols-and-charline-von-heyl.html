  \_\_\_\_\_ \u2014 Charline von Heyl\nThis exhibition\_inaugurates Rose Projects,\
  \ a new initiative at the Rose Art Museum. Each project series will consist of three\
  \ exhibitions addressing different aspects of a thematic, scholarly concern. Since\
  \ the 1970s, \u201Cproject\u201D exhibitions in U.S. museums have focused on monographic\
  \ presentations of young artists in an effort to inject the contemporary into institutional\
  \ contexts. With the aim of foregrounding curatorial thought and creativity, Rose\
  \ Projects, by contrast, emphasizes the timeliness of the idea structuring the related\
  \ projects, marrying careful scholarship to adventurous thinking.\_Rose Projects\
  \ 1, organized by Curator at Large Katy Siegel, focuses on artists who refuse the\
  \ categorical divides between representation and materialist abstraction, image\
  \ and object, looking instead for different models of reality through paintings\
  \ that exist on the threshold between the recognizable and the unknown. \nThe first\
  \ of Siegel\u2019s three exhibitions brings together artists from different historical\
  \ moments: Wols, born Alfred Otto Wolfgang Schulze (1913\u20131951) and Charline\
  \ von Heyl (b. 1960). Wols and von Heyl use traditional mediums in non-traditional\
  \ ways, broadening and reveling in the spectrum of possible colors, surfaces, and\
  \ images they can produce. For both artists, art has the potential to reveal profound\
  \ desires and realities that often remain unnoticed, or even invisible."
