  !!python/unicode 'description': 'The Gardner Museum recently commissioned Michael
    Van Valkenburgh to design a new four-season garden on the site of what Isabella
    Gardner called her Monks Garden. The redesigned Monks Garden, sited to the east
    of the historic palace, opened in September 2013 as part of the Museums expanded
    campus. CORRESPONDENCE features design process and construction drawings of the
    new garden, as well as communications between the design team and contractors
    responsible for its construction. The exhibition centers on a pair of letters
    between Museum director Anne Hawley and Van Valkenburgh describing their aspirations
    for the new garden at the beginning of the design process. The exhibition also
    presents photographs that illustrate how greatly the garden has changed over the
    years.Van Valkenburghs design of the Monks Garden interprets the Museums meandering
    gallery layout, and the rich colors and textures of its idiosyncratic collection,
    in a contemporary landscape context. While the garden is accessible (weather permitting)
    from both the original Museum building and Renzo Pianos new addition, it is not
    the primary connection between them, freeing it to focus instead on cultivating
    a sense of place. The garden is given its own interior, with the aim of provoking
    extended quiet contemplation rather than hurried passage.The original high brick
    wall of Fenway Court surrounds the garden, and the design aims to soften this
    enclosure through the creation of a small-scale, dreamlike woodland. Composed
    of approximately 60 trees including stewartia, paper bark maple, and gray birch,
    the groves establish a detail-rich palette of colors and textures suitable for
    intimate appreciation. Winding paths, paved in a striking combination of black
    brick and reflective mica schist, meander through the trees. Rather than intersecting,
    the paths playfully meet and diverge, while also gently widening in places to
    create nooks for garden chairs. Please join us in the new garden.', !!python/unicode 'id': '18',
