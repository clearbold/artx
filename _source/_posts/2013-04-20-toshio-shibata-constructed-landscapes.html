description: "One of Japan's preeminent landscape photographers, Toshio Shibata is\
  \ known for exploring the delicate balance between human-made structures and nature.\
  \ Photographing erosion control barriers, water catchments, roads, dams and bridges,\
  \ he examines the unique appearance of such structures in his native land. Through\
  \ his lens, riverbeds can look like origami, and waterfalls resemble kimono.This\
  \ exhibition of 28 large-format works will be the artist's first solo show in an\
  \ American museum since 1995 and the first time his color pictures will be shown\
  \ in America.Shibata was recently featured in a two-person show at the National\
  \ Arts Center, Tokyo, and in a solo retrospective at the Tokyo Metropolitan Museum.All\
  \ works are by Toshio Shibata, and appear courtesy of the artist; Gallery Luisotti,\
  \ Santa Monica; and Laurence Miller Gallery, New York. Black and white works are\
  \ gelatin silver prints, color works are color coupler prints. Support provided\
  \ by the East India Marine Associates of the Peabody Essex Museum.\_"
