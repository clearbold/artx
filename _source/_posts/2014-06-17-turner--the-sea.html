    the first full-scale examination of Joseph Mallord William Turner''s lifelong
    preoccupation with the sea, this exhibition features iconic works spanning the
    artist''s career from his transformative Academy paintings of the late 1790s and
    early 1800s, to the unfinished, experimental seascapes produced towards the end
    of his life. At turns dramatic, contemplative, beautiful and sublime, the sea''s
    mercurial properties captivated Turner and his contemporaries who repeatedly returned
    to the subject. Iconic Turner masterpieces are exhibited alongside works by other
    major European and American artists, providing a rich artistic context for Turner''s
    groundbreaking vision.Turner & the Sea was produced by the National Maritime  Museum,
    part of Royal Museums Greenwich, London. Supported by an  indemnity from the Federal
    Council on the Arts and the Humanities.Carolyn and Peter S. Lynch and The Lynch
    Foundation, and The Manton Foundation provided generous support.The East India
    Marine Associates of the Peabody Essex Museum also provided support.Media Partners:',
