    \ Rose Projects, a new initiative at the Rose Art Museum. Each project series\
    \ will consist of three exhibitions addressing different aspects of a thematic,\
    \ scholarly concern. Since the 1970s, project exhibitions in U.S. museums have\
    \ focused on monographic presentations of young artists in an effort to inject\
    \ the contemporary into institutional contexts. With the aim of foregrounding\
    \ curatorial thought and creativity, Rose Projects, by contrast, emphasizes the\
    \ timeliness of the idea structuring the related projects, marrying careful scholarship\
    \ to adventurous thinking.Rose Projects 1, organized by Curator at Large Katy\
    \ Siegel, focuses on artists who refuse the categorical divides between representation\
    \ and materialist abstraction, image and object, looking instead for different\
    \ models of reality through paintings that exist on the threshold between the\
    \ recognizable and the unknown. \nThe first of Siegels three exhibitions brings\
    \ together artists from different historical moments: Wols, born Alfred Otto Wolfgang\
    \ Schulze (19131951) and Charline von Heyl (b. 1960). Wols and von Heyl use traditional\
    \ mediums in non-traditional ways, broadening and reveling in the spectrum of\
    \ possible colors, surfaces, and images they can produce. For both artists, art\
    \ has the potential to reveal profound desires and realities that often remain\
    \ unnoticed, or even invisible.", !!python/unicode 'id': '25', !!python/unicode 'image': 'http://brandeis.edu/rose/images/2014s/Rose
