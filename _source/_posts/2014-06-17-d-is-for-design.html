    drawings are among the hidden treasures of the MFAs collection, and this exhibition
    displays nearly 30 works on paper, each representing a different artist, architect,
    or designer in an alphabet of design from the 16th through the 20th centuries.
    A is for Ashbee: a design for a ring by the Arts and Crafts designer and social
    reformer C. R. Ashbee; L is for La Farge: a design for stained glass by the artist
    and designer John La Farge; and R is for Rossi: an architectural model by the
    renowned 20th-century Italian architect Aldo Rossi. The surprising juxtaposition
    of unrelated but visually compelling designs for architecture, theater, stained
    glass, furniture, jewelry and silver, and textilesmany of which are rarely, if
    ever, on viewpresents an opportunity for visitors to engage with questions surrounding
    design, from technical to artistic.Above: Frank Lloyd Wright, June, The Garden
