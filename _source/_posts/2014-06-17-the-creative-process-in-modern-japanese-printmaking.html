    the 20th century, printmaking in Japan became not just a way of producing popular
    images but a fine art form. No longer constrained by the requirements of commercial
    publishing, artists were able to exploit the color woodblock process as far as
    their imaginations could take them, and to experiment with new Western media as
    well.This exhibition showcases the MFAs holdings in the area of 20th-century Japanese
    prints, including both shin hanga made by the traditional collaborative method
    and ssaku hanga produced by a single artist working alone. Prints are shown along
    with preliminary drawings, woodblocks, artists proofs, and variant versions printed
    from the same blocks, highlighting the interplay of creativity and technique in
    printmaking.A variety of materials, from Takei Takeos miniature artist books to
    large collaborative prints, gives visitors an intriguing behind-the-scenes look
    at the work of modern Japanese print artists.The exhibitions centerpiece is the
    complete set of the six large prints entitled Sailboats (1926) by Yoshida Hiroshi.
    This iconic work, probably the single best-known example of shin hanga, collaborative
    method, uses the same woodblocks printed in six different color schemes to show
    the boats at different times of day; the printing is so skillful that works from
    this series are sometimes mistaken for watercolors.Above: Yoshida Hiroshi, Sailboats:
