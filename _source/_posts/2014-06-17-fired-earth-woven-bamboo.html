    the last decade, the exciting shapes and technical finesse in Japanese contemporary
    ceramics and baskets have attracted new audiences among Western enthusiasts. Recently
    attention has centered on more abstract works produced by modern ceramic and bamboo
    artists, including pioneering female ceramists, who, beginning in the 1950s, turned
    to abstract sculpture or architecture for their inspiration, creating innovative,
    expressive sculptural pieces rooted in traditional materials and techniques but
    that transcend utilitarian forms. Fired Earth, Woven Bamboo celebrates contemporary
    Japanese decorative arts at the MFA, thanks to the recent gift of works spanning
    the late 20th and early 21st centuries from Stanley and Mary Ann Snider. More
    than 60 dramatic ceramics and baskets from the Snider Collection are complemented
    by contemporary Japanese quilts and fabric screens and an example of sophisticated
    paper sculpture, highlighting the revolution in these traditional media in creative
    abstraction.Above: Sakurai Yasuko, Vertical Flower, Heisei era, 2007. Porcelain.
