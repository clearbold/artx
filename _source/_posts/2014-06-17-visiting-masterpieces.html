    sides in an intense debate among leading authorities on Italian art and learn
    the possible answers to the question: What makes a Caravaggio? Visiting Masterpieces:
    Caravaggio and Connoisseurship introduces visitors to the art of judging whether
    a Caravaggio is, in fact, a Caravaggio. Four works never before seen in Boston
    provide an inside look at the complexities of connoisseurship and attribution.
    Caravaggios Fortune Teller (about 159495) and Fra Antonio Martelli, Knight Grand
    Cross of the Order of Malta (about 1608), once doubted by experts, are now considered
    benchmark works by this artist. Two more paintingsMaffeo Barberini (about 1596)
    andSaint Francis in Meditation (about 1595)are at the center of ongoing debates.
    Organized by the Muscarelle Museum of Art, the exhibition allows visitors to employ
    the analytical thinking of experts and decide for themselves: which could be true
    Caravaggios? Visitors are encouraged to tweet their opinions using the hashtag
    #TrueCaravaggio and follow @mfaboston for conversation about the paintings.Above:
