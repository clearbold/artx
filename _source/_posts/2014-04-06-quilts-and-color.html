description: "\u201CQuilts and Color\u201D celebrates the vibrant color palette and\
  \ inventive design seen in the acclaimed Pilgrim/Roy Quilt Collection. The exhibition\
  \ features nearly 60 distinctive quilts from the renowned collection and is the\
  \ first to explore how, over five decades, trained artists Paul Pilgrim and Gerald\
  \ Roy searched out and collected quilts with bold, eye-popping designs that echoed\
  \ the work of mid-20th century Abstract Expressionist and Op Artists.The exhibition\
  \ opens with the vividly colored quilts that first drew the collectors\u2019 attention\
  \ and began their life-long passion. Exploring sophisticated principles of color\
  \ theory, the exhibition\u2019s opening sections display color vibrations, mixtures,\
  \ gradations, and harmonies in the design of the quilts ranging from the 19th to\
  \ early 20th century. As their collection grew, Pilgrim and Roy turned their interest\
  \ to the history of quilting and added more traditional designs. Many of these incorporated\
  \ the color white to create high contrast. The exhibition\u2019s sections\u2014\u201C\
  Variations\u201D and \u201COptical Illusions\u201D\u2014examine the effect of color\
  \ and pattern, highlighting dramatic color choices and innovative effects created\
  \ within established quilt patterns. The exhibition concludes with a final nod to\
  \ the artistic vision of quilt makers and highlights artists who worked outside\
  \ of standard patterns and design.Above: Double Wedding Ring Quilt, about 1940.\
