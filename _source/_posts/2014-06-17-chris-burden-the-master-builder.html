    \ Falls Bridge, 2003, Stainless steel reproduction Mysto Type I Erector parts,\
    \ wood base. Photo by Douglas Parker, courtesy of Chris Burden Studio.In his pioneering\
    \ performances of the 1970s, Los Angeles-based artist Chris Burden (b. 1946) gained\
    \ a reputation for testing limits: of his own body, and of institutions and publics\
    \ variously implicated in his provocative actions. Both beautiful and extreme,\
    \ iconic performances like Shoot (1971), TV Hijack (1972), and Transfixed (1974)\
    \ forced viewers to confront the most pressing moral and political issues of the\
    \ day through allegory and metaphor. Burden considered these early performances\
    \ live sculptures in space. Beginning in the late-1970s, his interests turned\
    \ from these live sculpture events and towards the production of permanent three-dimensional\
    \ objects. \nCHRIS BURDEN: THE MASTER BUILDER presents a near comprehensive account\
    \ of Burdens small-scale Erector set bridges. Modeled after bridges imagined and\
    \ real, the artists Erector set sculptures extend his work as a social engineer,\
    \ demonstrating his dual commitment to empirical and symbolic inquiry. Burdens\
    \ bridges are constructed from vintage and reproduced Meccano and Erector parts,\
    \ perforated metal construction toys first marketed at the start of the 20th century.As\
    \ part of The Master Builder,Burden is constructing a two-story Erector set skyscraper\
    \ that will be installed in the museum in April.\nIn addition to this exhibition,\
    \ the Rose has commissioned Chris Burden to create a permanent, outdoor sculpture\
    \ for the museums front lawn entitled Light of Reason, which will be completed\
    \ in fall 2014.", !!python/unicode 'id': '23', !!python/unicode 'image': 'http://brandeis.edu/rose/images/2014s/Rose
