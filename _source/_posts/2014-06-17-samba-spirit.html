    the first time the MFA presents a selection of works by 20th-century Brazilian
    artists of African descent. Rarely studied in the United States, these painters
    and sculptors drew on indigenous, European, and African traditions, and found
    inspiration in all aspects of Brazilian lifereligious rituals, urban and rural
    life, music, and dance. Each artist has a distinct approach to subject, style,
    and iconography creating a lively range of imagery. The exhibition features key
    works by Heitor dos Prazeres, Maria Auxiliadora da Silva, and Waldemiro de Deus.
