  Visiting Masterpieces: Caravaggio and Connoisseurship\u201D introduces visitors\
  \ to the art of judging whether a Caravaggio is, in fact, a Caravaggio. Four works\
  \ never before seen in Boston provide an inside look at the complexities of connoisseurship\
  \ and attribution. Caravaggio\u2019s Fortune Teller (about 1594\u201395) and Fra\
  \ Antonio Martelli, Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Malta (about 1608), once\
  \ doubted by experts, are now considered benchmark works by this artist. Two more\
  \ paintings\u2014Maffeo Barberini (about 1596) and\_Saint Francis in Meditation\
  \ (about 1595)\u2014are at the center of ongoing debates. Organized by the Muscarelle\
  \ Museum of Art, the exhibition allows visitors to employ the \_analytical thinking\
  \ of experts and decide for themselves: which could be true Caravaggios? Visitors\
