description: Explore the  living relationships among humans, animals, ancestors and  supernatural
  beings through works of Native art from the Pacific  Northwest Coast created during
  the past 200 years. Ceremonial regalia, trade goods and art sold in galleries today
  reveal creative expressions of family, heritage, politics and commerce in a changing
  world. Raven's Many Gifts presents artworks that convey broadly shared aesthetic
  and cultural traditions while emphasizing the distinctiveness of various indigenous
  communities and their artists. The themes - Living Stories, Family Connections and
  Market Innovations - feature objects from PEM's renowned collection of Native American
  art from the Northwest Coast. The Raven in the installation's title is the Northwest
  Coast culture hero who brought light to the world.
