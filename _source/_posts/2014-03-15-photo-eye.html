description: "Photographers working in Europe during the period between the two World\
  \ Wars made some of the most memorable images in the medium\u2019s history. Their\
  \ goal was to infuse their medium with a fresh and distinctly \u201Cmodern\u201D\
  \ style. Influenced by Cubism, Constructivism, Dadaism, and Surrealism, and reflecting\
  \ the effects that technology, urbanization, and cinema were having on their time,\
  \ European photographers adopted unconventional and innovative approaches to their\
  \ image making. Characteristics of their visions include rigorous objectivity, surprising\
  \ camera angles, and darkroom experimentation. \u201CPhoto Eye: Avant-Garde Photography\
  \ in Europe\u201D charts this shift through the work of artists such as Constantin\
  \ Brancusi, Ilse Bing, Andr\xE9 Kert\xE9sz, Man Ray, L\xE1szl\xF3 Moholy-Nagy, and\
  \ Josef Sudek. Their contributions and those of their peers were central to a transformation\
  \ in photographic expression in the 20th century. The exhibition includes a number\
  \ of important new acquisitions, along with select loans.Above: Ilse Bing, Can Can\
