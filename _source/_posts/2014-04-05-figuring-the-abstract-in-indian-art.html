description: This installation of 20th-century paintings and 15th- to 19th-century
  sculptures explores the concept of abstraction as a vehicle for embodying form and
  meaning. Moving beyond culture and across time, these works consider style, structure
  and color, as well as the figurative, metaphorical and idealized as key facets of
  the abstract.The works on view are drawn from PEM's Chester and Davida Herwitz Collection,
  the most important holding of 20th-century contemporary art from India in this country,
  the Dr. Leo Figiel Collection of bronze sculpture and The Tina and Anil Ambani Collection,
  one of India's leading private collections.See more about the bronze sculptures
