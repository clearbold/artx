  \ Mysto Type I Erector parts, wood base. Photo by Douglas Parker, courtesy of Chris\
  \ Burden Studio.In his pioneering performances of the 1970s, Los Angeles-based artist\
  \ Chris Burden (b. 1946) gained a reputation for testing limits: of his own body,\
  \ and of institutions and publics variously implicated in his provocative actions.\
  \ Both beautiful and extreme, iconic performances like Shoot (1971), TV Hijack (1972),\
  \ and Transfixed (1974) forced viewers to confront the most pressing moral and political\
  \ issues of the day through allegory and metaphor.\_ Burden considered these early\
  \ performances live sculptures in space. Beginning in the late-1970s, his interests\
  \ turned from these live sculpture events and towards the production of permanent\
  \ three-dimensional objects.\_ \nCHRIS BURDEN: THE MASTER BUILDER presents a near\
  \ comprehensive account of Burden\u2019s small-scale Erector set bridges.\_ Modeled\
  \ after bridges imagined and real, the artist\u2019s Erector set sculptures extend\
  \ his work as a social engineer, demonstrating his dual commitment to empirical\
  \ and symbolic inquiry.\_ Burden\u2019s bridges are constructed from vintage and\
  \ reproduced Meccano and Erector parts, perforated metal construction toys first\
  \ marketed at the start of the 20th century.\_As part of The Master Builder,\_Burden\
  \ is constructing a two-story Erector set skyscraper that will be installed in the\
  \ museum in April.\nIn addition to this exhibition, the Rose has commissioned Chris\
  \ Burden to create a permanent, outdoor sculpture for the museum\u2019s front lawn\
  \ entitled Light of Reason, which will be completed in fall 2014."
