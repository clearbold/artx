description: "Tcherepnin\u2019s sound recordings, emanating from a floor built above\
  \ the List\u2019s existing Bakalar Gallery floor, become a physical music: through\
  \ transducers, Tcherepnin\u2019s composition transforms the floor itself into a\
  \ vibrating speaker. Sound is sensed through one\u2019s bone, skin, and body-mass\
  \ as much as through one\u2019s auditory or visual system, and the body becomes\
  \ a reservoir of potentials for different patterns of listening. In turn, the gallery\
  \ itself becomes a space of overlapping physiological registers: the floor becomes\
  \ a \u201Cbone\u201D that speaks in tones, thumps, and grumbles, its voice transmitted\
  \ not through the air but directly from floor to human, from \u201Cbone to bone\u201D\
  ; fabric elements become skins that mediate sound in different ways; and metal forms\
  \ derived from the shape of the tongue and mouth emerge from the floor and walls.\
  \ These forms are physical sound systems that speak, characters that at times invite,\
  \ at times rebuff, interaction, with each state a point of departure for other sounds\
  \ and trajectories of listening. By creating an order of coexistence and succession\
  \ that opens up a logic of the senses, Tcherepnin\u2019s work looks to how both\
  \ things and bodies can be constituted through sound.About the ArtistSergei Tcherepnin\
  \ was born in Boston in 1981, and currently lives and works in New York. He received\
