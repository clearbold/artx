description: "Evelyn Rydz (b. 1979, Miami) received an MFA from the School of the\
  \ Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, in 2005. Rydz explores America's coasts, photographing\
  \ the manufactured remnants of modern life that wash up on the shoreline. Plastic's\
  \ resilience is exactly the quality that makes it valuable to us, but what we use,\
  \ discard, and dump in the sea is useless to marine life. Materials that never decay\
  \ become a permanent part of the oceanic ecosystem. Nature's attempt to reclaim\
  \ these cast-offs fascinates Rydz, who draws our attention to their transformation\
  \ on their long journey along the global ocean current, and to the larger implications\
  \ of society's everyday actions. This exhibition is the first to include Rydz's\
  \ bold photographs, which, combined with her delicate drawings, depict these fragments\
  \ in surprising ways.Prior to receiving the SMFA\u2019s prestigious Traveling Scholars\
  \ Fellowship, Rydz\u2019s research focused on the Atlantic. The fellowship presented\
  \ her with the opportunity to explore the Pacific and see for herself the nexus\
  \ of marine debris: Kamilo Point, Hawaii. She explains, \u201CI walked for days\
  \ through massive amounts of debris and plastic sands feeling like an archaeologist\
  \ excavating the residues of contemporary history.\u201DAbove: Evelyn Rydz, Postcards\
