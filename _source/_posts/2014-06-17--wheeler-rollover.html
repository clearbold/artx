    Park intervention, 4-Wheeler Rollover, Okay Mountain stages a rebellious joy ride
    that rips through deCordovas pristine campus and terminates in an upturned All-Terrain
    Vehicle (ATV). The eight-member artist collective casts the freewheeling tire
    treads in tinted concrete, to give permanence to the normally ephemeral tracks,
    and to place the vehicle in dialogue with the more traditional sculptures that
    surround it. By deliberately crashing lowbrow thrillcraft culture into the highbrow
    space of fine art, Okay Mountain orchestrates the kind of witty cultural collision
    for which they are known.Based in Austin, TX, the artists of Okay Mountain (Carlos
    Rosales-Silva, Corkey Sinks, Josh Rios, Justin Goldwater, Ryan Hennessee, Nathan
    Green, Peat Duggins, Michael Sieben, Sterling Allen, Tim Brown), have been working
    collaboratively since 2006 when they formed an artist-run alternative gallery.
    Since then, the group has exhibited their installation projects throughout the
    United States and in Mexico City. Their large-scale sculptural projects blend
    humor with a big Texan mentality and aesthetic, are rife with art historical references
    and laced with social critique. With 4-Wheeler Rollover, the art historically
    savvy artists riff off the long and hallowed tradition of Land Art by taking the
    Sculpture Parkonce the manicured lawn of Julian de Cordovaas their canvas, but
    revisit this history through the unexpected language of American consumer culture
    and recreation. The collective carves up the Park with a wink, a nod, and a slight
    jab at Land Artists like Michael Heizer, who excavated huge trenches and choreographed
    lyrical motorcycle track drawings in the desert. Their brand of smart, bawdy interventions
    coyly critique the institutionalization of art and invite us all along for the
    ride.Okay Mountain has exhibited at Freight + Volume, NY; Austin Museum of Art,
    TX; Galeria Enrique Guerrero in Mexico City, Mexico; Paragraph in Kansas City,
    KS; PULSE in Miami,FL; Texas State University in San Marcos, TX; the Creative
    Research Lab in Austin, TX; Prosect 1.5 in New Orleans, LA; the Blaffer Art Museum,
    Houston, TX; and McNay Art Museum, San Antonio, TX. While most of the Okay Mountain
    members are alumni of the University of Texas at Austin, others are graduates
    of the University of California, Los Angeles; the Rhode Island School of Design;
    and the University of Kansas.Images  Andy Ryan.', !!python/unicode 'id': '21',
