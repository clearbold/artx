    \ ambitious survey exhibition of the work of the internationally renowned Scottish\
    \ artist, poet, and garden designer Ian Hamilton Finlay showcases over 200 objects\
    \ including sculptures, prints, and books. The show is the first museum exhibition\
    \ of the artists work in the United States since his show at the Philadelphia\
    \ Museum of Art in 1992; the exhibition is also the first of the artists work\
    \ in the United States since his death in 2006. In addition to filling deCordovas\
    \ Linde and Foster Galleries, the exhibition contains a number of works installed\
    \ outdoors in the Sculpture Park.After founding Wild Hawthorn Press in 1961 and\
    \ publishing hundreds of artists books, Finlay rose to prominence as one of Great\
    \ Britains foremost experimental literary artists making concrete poetry, a practice\
    \ which wed language with sculptural form. In 1966, he and his wife Sue Finlay\
    \ built Little Sparta, a garden in Dunsyre, Scotland, which became the site for\
    \ the ultimate realization of his aesthetic program. Finlay treated Little Sparta\
    \ as a site for engaging with cultural inquiry and criticism rather than as a\
    \ sanctuary or more traditional pastoral setting; he literally placed language\
    \ into the landscape in monumental form, encouraging a discourse on the reconciliation\
    \ between nature and modern society.Finlay freely mined human history to source\
    \ imagery for his work. He believed that most positive symbols in Western culture\
    \ had been drained of their meaning through consumerist assimilation and desensitization,\
    \ and so employed universally powerful symbols of violence and authority such\
    \ as machine guns, tanks, and guillotines in his work. Finlays merger of beauty,\
    \ violence, and the sacred spoke to his belief in the disintegration of contemporary\
    \ societys cultural ideals. When encountered in juxtaposition to emblems of nature\
    \ and classical idealism, Finlays epigrams provoke contemplation of societys need\
    \ for a reclamation of civic and aesthetic values.Several works demonstrating\
    \ Finlays signature fusion of classical beauty and violence are on view in deCordovas\
    \ exhibition. Apollo/Saint Just after Bernini (1985-2003) is a suite of bronze\
    \ sculptures of the youthful Olympian deity, each equippedupon closer inspectionwith\
    \ modern weapons such as hand grenades and submachine guns, rather than flutes\
    \ or harps. Similarly, Finlays Aphrodite de la Terreur (Aphrodite of the Terror)\
    \ (1987) is a plaster sculpture of the Greek goddess of love, beauty, and sexualitythis\
    \ time adorned with a modest red necklace, a chilling reference to the red string\
    \ worn around the necks of mourning relatives of the beheaded during the French\
    \ Revolution.Finlays work often commands attention through his simple visual and\
    \ verbal plays on language: Wildflower Vase (1985) is an ephemeral bouquet in\
    \ a classical white vase labeled with the text \"Wildflower: A Mean Term between\
    \ Revolution and Virtue.\" Finlays text causes the works immediate beauty and\
    \ representation of nature to become a prompt for the contemplation of communal\
    \ mindfulness. In a comparable gesture, Finlays Panzer Leader (1976) is a cast\
    \ tortoise whose shell is embossed with the word Panzer, a German word that can\
    \ be translated as tank, armor, or turtle shell. Although Panzer Leader appears\
    \ to be an unassuming, tank-like reptile at first glance, Finlays application\
    \ of language quickly renders it a more sinister evocation of the thunderous crush\
    \ of German tanks during World War II.Finlays challenging engagement with landscape\
    \ and history does not make allowance for a passive viewing experience. The artists\
    \ work encourages viewers to question the role of the detached consumer and to\
    \ utilize the tools of awareness that Finlay presents in his work in order to\
    \ consider their responsibility in articulating the future of society.Funding\
    \ for this exhibition has been provided by an anonymous donor and Joyce Linde.Ian\
    \ Hamilton Finlay was born to Scottish parents in the Bahamas in 1926, and his\
    \ family returned to Glasgow when he was a child. Although his formal education\
    \ ended with the outbreak of World War II, Finlay began to write short stories\
    \ and play while working as a shepherd during his early adulthood. He rose to\
    \ prominence as one of Great Britains foremost experimental literary artists after\
    \ founding Wild Hawthorn Press in 1961, through which he published hundreds of\
    \ artists books. Finlay died in 2006 in Edinburgh, Scotland.Today, Finlay is regarded\
    \ as one of the most influential British artists of the twentieth century for\
    \ his work as sculptor, poet, and landscape designer. Finlays work has been exhibited\
    \ internationally, including solo exhibitions at the Philadelphia Museum of Art,\
    \ Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Tate Gallery, London, England; and the Wadsworth\
    \ Athenaeum, Hartford, Connecticut. In addition to being collected by numerous\
    \ institutions, his work has also been permanently installed in public and private\
    \ outdoor spaces throughout Europe and North America. Together with his wife,\
    \ Sue Finlay, the artist created Little Sparta, a vast garden at Stonypath in\
    \ Dunsyre, Scotland, which blends landscape, sculpture, and language, and currently\
    \ contains nearly 300 examples of the artists work.Lunch and Tour with a Curator:\
