  \ York.MIKA ROTTENBERG: BOWLS BALLS SOULS HOLES is Rottenberg\u2019s (b. 1976) first\
  \ solo museum exhibition in the United States. Conceived in relation to the Rose\u2019\
  s expansive Lois Foster Gallery, the exhibition offers a selective account of the\
  \ thematic and formal interests that have structured Rottenberg\u2019s development\
  \ to date. In addition to Squeeze (2010) and Tsss (2013), the Rose will present\
  \ Rottenberg\u2019s newest video installation, Bowls Balls Souls Holes (2014), a\
  \ major new work commissioned and funded in part by the museum. \nRottenberg uses\
  \ the moving image as a device to relate impossibly disparate\u2014and often highly\
  \ eccentric\u2014characters, places, and activities, collapsing the space between\
  \ them to produce parallel worlds. The artist\u2019s videos and the sculptural environments\
  \ that contain them re-imagine space and time to bring fantastical narratives of\
  \ production and consumption to life, and the resulting installations disorient\
  \ and transport the viewer to a place where weird and wonderful production lines\
  \ abide by their own hermetic, relentless logic. Rich in material eccentricity,\
  \ marginal subjectivities, and narrative absurdity, Mika Rottenberg takes the world\
  \ we share apart and returns it to us in a form that is as strange and foreign as\
  \ it is deeply felt and resonant.\nThe exhibition will be accompanied by a monograph\
  \ on the artist with essays by Christopher Bedford, Julia Bryan-Wilson, and Wayne\
  \ Koestenbaum."
