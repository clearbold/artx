    Michael Lin began developing a reputation in the late 1990s for painting vast,
    bold designs on sober architectural settings, interventions that injected a vibrant
    sense of play. At PEM Lin spotlights the renowned collection of Asian export art.
    Lin created a sprawling mural of original armorial and heraldic motifs (elaborate
    coats of arms) that climb up the walls of the Mellon Staircase and along the floor
    of the Export Silver Galleries.To animate the history of trade between China and
    the West, Lin also created a large-scale installation comprised of hundreds of
    replicas of Mr. Nobody, one of the first representations of a European gentleman
    in Chinese porcelain. Photographs that document the creation of the replicas in
    a factory in China are interspersed among 19th-century gouaches from the PEM collection
    that depict the historic porcelain production process.Generous support for FreePort
