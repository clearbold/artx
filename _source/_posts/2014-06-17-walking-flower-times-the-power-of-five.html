    Surls is an internationally renowned American sculptor whose work uses industrial
    materials to speak to the undeniable beauty of the natural world. In his abstract
    creations, Surls plays with dueling themes of nature and industrialization, and
    explores how materials such as bronze, plastic, and steel can be manipulated into
    an expression of humanity. Raised in rural Texas, Surls developed an interest
    in the complex relationship between nature and machinery while working on oil
    industry pipelines, a bond that inspires much of his sculpture.In Walking Flower
    Times the Power of Five, Surls employs his recurring motif of a beautiful flower
    to represent the softer, more majestic side of human nature while contrasting
    it with the hardness of the wheel-like botanicals bare branches. The result is
    a surreal flower that seems as though it is breathing and alive and could walk
    or roll away at a moments notice. Though made of steel, Surls sculpture has an
    organic quality that appears simultaneously earthly and otherworldly.The title,
    Walking Flower Times the Power of Five, reminds us of the science in nature and
    the presence of numerical permutations in our everyday surroundings. The sculpture
    has a core of five arms whose branches double and then quadruple until there are
    a total of one hundred arms. With every extension yielding a factor of five, Surls
    allows the viewer to see the logic that is omnipresent in the chaotic beauty of
    nature.James Surls received a BS from Sam Houston State College and a MFA from
    Cranbrook Academy of Art. He taught at Southern Methodist University and the University
    of Houston until 1982. In 1979, he helped to establish the Lawndale Art and Performance
    Center in Houston, a space for local artists to expose a wider audience to contemporary
    art. In the midst of Lawndale and his teaching career, Surls moved to Splendora,
    Texas which marked the beginning of a twenty year period of intense artistic productivity.
    His retrospective: James Surls: The Splendora Years; 1977-1997 came to deCordova
    in 2006. Walking Flower Times the Power of Five was displayed in 2012 on the Rose
    F. Kennedy Greenway in the center of downtown Boston and was also exhibited in
    2009 for the Art in the Parks Program on Park Avenue in New York City.', !!python/unicode 'id': '22',
