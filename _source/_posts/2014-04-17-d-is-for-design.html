description: "Design drawings are among the hidden treasures of the MFA\u2019s collection,\
  \ and this exhibition displays nearly 30 works on paper, each representing a different\
  \ artist, architect, or designer in an alphabet of design from the 16th through\
  \ the 20th centuries. A is for Ashbee: a design for a ring by the Arts and Crafts\
  \ designer and social reformer C. R. Ashbee; L is for La Farge: a design for stained\
  \ glass by the artist and designer John La Farge; and R is for Rossi: an architectural\
  \ model by the renowned 20th-century Italian architect Aldo Rossi. The surprising\
  \ juxtaposition of unrelated but visually compelling designs for architecture, theater,\
  \ stained glass, furniture, jewelry and silver, and textiles\u2014many of which\
  \ are rarely, if ever, on view\u2014presents an opportunity for visitors to engage\
  \ with questions surrounding design, from technical to artistic.Above: Frank Lloyd\
