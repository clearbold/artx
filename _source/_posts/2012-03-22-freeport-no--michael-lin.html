description: "Artist Michael Lin began developing a reputation in the late 1990s for\
  \ painting vast, bold designs on sober architectural settings, interventions that\
  \ injected a vibrant sense of play. At PEM Lin spotlights the renowned collection\
  \ of Asian export art. Lin created a sprawling mural of original armorial and heraldic\
  \ motifs (elaborate coats of arms) that climb up the walls of the Mellon Staircase\
  \ and along the floor of the Export Silver Galleries.To animate the history of trade\
  \ between China and the West, Lin also created a large-scale installation comprised\
  \ of hundreds of replicas of Mr. Nobody, one of the first representations of a European\
  \ gentleman in Chinese porcelain. Photographs that document the creation of the\
  \ replicas in a factory in China are interspersed among 19th-century gouaches from\
  \ the PEM collection that depict the historic porcelain production process.Generous\
