    Abbass art installation on the front of the Gardner Museum shows the spectacular
    silk and gold curtain (kiswa) that covers the door of the Kaaba in Mecca, Islams
    holiest and most venerated site. The artist was inspired by a small plaster cast
    of this object displayed in her mothers house in Lahore, Pakistan. Creating a
    version of this quintessential Islamic image for her adopted city of Boston, the
    artist seeks to diffuse the prevailing tension between East and West by bringing
    visitors in contact with the unfamiliar through visual art."Last summer," Abbas
    says, "I found this cheap plaster imitation of the Kaaba door in my mother''s
    house in Lahore. It was hanging askew with a sizable layer of dust, which is not
    surprising for my mom, where chaos takes another meaning all together. However,
    it made me take notice of similar happenings in other places, while visiting friends
    and family and during my interaction with people in public spaces, so eventually
    I started documenting them. For me these small imperfections reveal the human
    element that co-exists with the seemingly monolithic ideals of truth and perfection."Abbas
    is the third artist invited to create site-specific work for the Gardner faade.
    The space is devoted to new work by Gardner Museum Artists-in-Residence and changes
    about every six months. Abbas came to the Gardner as an Artist-in-Residence in
    2011.Hamra Abbas''s residency at the Gardner Museum was supported in part by The
    Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts. The Museum receives operating support
    from the Massachusetts Cultural Council.Image: Clements Photography, 2013.', !!python/unicode 'id': '13',
