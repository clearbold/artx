description: "James Surls is an internationally renowned American sculptor whose work\
  \ uses industrial materials to speak to the undeniable beauty of the natural world.\
  \ In his abstract creations, Surls plays with dueling themes of nature and industrialization,\
  \ and explores how materials such as bronze, plastic, and steel can be manipulated\
  \ into an expression of humanity. Raised in rural Texas, Surls developed an interest\
  \ in the complex relationship between nature and machinery while working on oil\
  \ industry pipelines, a bond that inspires much of his sculpture.In Walking Flower\
  \ Times the Power of Five, Surls employs his recurring motif of a beautiful flower\
  \ to represent the softer, more majestic side of human nature while contrasting\
  \ it with the hardness of the wheel-like botanical\u2019s bare branches. The result\
  \ is a surreal flower that seems as though it is breathing and alive and could walk\
  \ or roll away at a moment\u2019s notice. Though made of steel, Surls\u2019 sculpture\
  \ has an organic quality that appears simultaneously earthly and otherworldly.The\
  \ title, Walking Flower Times the Power of Five, reminds us of the science in nature\
  \ and the presence of numerical permutations in our everyday surroundings. The sculpture\
  \ has a core of five arms whose branches double and then quadruple until there are\
  \ a total of one hundred arms. With every extension yielding a factor of five, Surls\
  \ allows the viewer to see the logic that is omnipresent in the chaotic beauty of\
  \ nature.James Surls received a BS from Sam Houston State College and a MFA from\
  \ Cranbrook Academy of Art. He taught at Southern Methodist University and the University\
  \ of Houston until 1982. In 1979, he helped to establish the Lawndale Art and Performance\
  \ Center in Houston, a space for local artists to expose a wider audience to contemporary\
  \ art. In the midst of Lawndale and his teaching career, Surls moved to Splendora,\
  \ Texas which marked the beginning of a twenty year period of intense artistic productivity.\
  \ His retrospective: James Surls: The Splendora Years; 1977-1997 came to deCordova\
  \ in 2006.\_ Walking Flower Times the Power of Five was displayed in 2012 on the\
  \ Rose F. Kennedy Greenway in the center of downtown Boston and was also exhibited\
  \ in 2009 for the Art in the Parks Program on Park Avenue in New York City."
