  \ and Community will explore the traditions and techniques of indigenous Mexican\
  \ artisans and how they can be applied to modern fashion and styles.Carla Fern\xE1\
  ndez has gained international recognition for her  extraordinary approach to documenting\
  \ and preserving the rich textile heritage of Mexico's indigenous communities by\
  \  transforming it into beautiful contemporary clothing, and proving tradition is\
  \ anything but static.This first-ever fashion exhibition at the Gardner Museum explores\
  \ the development of a new language in visual design that Fern\xE1ndez has built\
  \ over two decades. She uses a method called \"the Square Root\" based on  the Mexican\
  \ tradition of making clothing from squares and rectangles. This process emphasizes\
  \ forms of fabric  and delicate, thoughtful construction based on whole fabric,\
  \ as opposed to cutting in curves and molding to  the body.The Barefoot Designer\
  \ is multi-faceted exhibition consisting of garments, textiles, drawings, photographs,\
  \ performance, video,  workshops and source materials demonstrating Fern\xE1ndez's\
  \ multi-layered design process. A key component of that process is her design workshop\
  \ Taller Flora, a mobile laboratory that collaborates with Mexico's indigenous communities,\
  \ a sustainable business model based on close collaboration with and recognition\
  \ of local knowledge and talent. During her  career, Fern\xE1ndez has worked with\
  \ many indigenous communities throughout Mexico. The exhibition will highlight the\
  \ styles and techniques of five states: Chiapas, Yucatan, Campeche, the State of\
  \ Mexico and Mexico City.Mobility and collaboration can be seen and felt throughout\
  \ the exhibition: in its installation, multiple films and monthly dance  performances,\
  \ as well as workshops for the public. The garments and mannequins are positioned\
  \ on life-sized, mobile  displays. Fern\xE1ndez has also activated the garments\
  \ through a live and filmed dance performance by dancers Raushan Mitchell  and Silas\
  \ Reiner, bringing to life the notion of \"clothing as canvas.\" The exhibition\
  \ will include short process videos of weavers, embroiderers, and carpenters by\
  \ photographer and filmmaker Ramiro Chaves, as well as fashion films produced by\
  \ Chaves and Pedro Torres in New York City, Boston and Mexico City. A series of\
  \ fashion photos by photographer Graciela Iturbide will be on view. A large workshop\
  \ table adds a hands-on visitor experience to the exhibition, with a variety of\
  \ workshops scheduled. Fern\xE1ndez will run a two-day clothing workshop as well\
  \ as workshops with the Gardner's School and  Community Partnership Programs.\"\
  I want people to understand that you can find happiness many different ways, and\
  \ one way is by creating goods by hand and making things unique to the artist,\"\
  \ Fern\xE1ndez said. \"Discovering the process helps people to understand how these\
  \ different worlds work, because you fall in love with the artisan, and then you\
  \ fall in love with the piece. You can create a whole economy  based on the artists,\
  \ and how their work is made.\"Learn more about Carla Ferna\u0301ndez's residency\
