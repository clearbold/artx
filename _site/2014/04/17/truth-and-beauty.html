description: "Photographers known as the Pictorialists, who worked around 1900, were\
  \ part of the first international movement in the history of the medium. Their mission\
  \ was to prove the artistic merit of photography by strengthening its connections\
  \ with the fine arts. To this end they made images that sought to represent truth\
  \ and beauty; that were atmospheric; that had poetic, literary, or spiritual value;\
  \ and that emphasized the role of the photographer as a craftsman. Figures such\
  \ as Alfred Stieglitz, Edward Steichen, Frederick H. Evans, Alvin Langdon Coburn,\
  \ Gertrude K\xE4sebier, and Clarence H. White made spectacular images influenced\
  \ by current art trends, including Impressionism, Symbolism, and the Arts and Crafts\
  \ movement.The Pictorialists primarily utilized two printing processes: platinum,\
  \ with its extraordinary tonal richness, and gum bichromate, a labor-intensive process\
  \ that involved hand coating papers with carefully prepared emulsions and pigments.\
  \ They often presented their images by mounting them on papers that were specially\
  \ lined or colored, like fine art drawings, and they sometimes showed them in specially\
  \ designed frames.This exhibition celebrates the MFA\u2019s recent acquisition of\
  \ four major works related to the Boston leader of the movement, F. Holland Day.\
  \ His The Seven Last Words (1898), purchased in 2013, is a centerpiece of the show\
  \ and was recently called \u201Can important touchstone of Modernist photography,\u201D\
  \ by The New York Times. Day daringly styled himself in this series as Christ wearing\
  \ a crown of thorns. The other three photographs\u2014portraits of Day by Edward\
  \ Steichen, James Craig Annan, and Clarence H. White\u2014are also included. A small\
  \ number of significant loans from private collections are also on view.Above: F.\
  \ Holland Day, The Seven Last Words (detail), 1898. Photographs, seven platinum\
  \ prints in original frame. Barbara M. Marshall Fund, Frank B. Bemis Fund, Otis\
  \ Norcross Fund, William E. Nickerson Fund, Lucy Dalbiac Luard Fund, and funds by\
  \ exchange from a Gift of James Lawrence, Dorothy Mackenzie and John E. Lawrence,\
  \ and funds donated by Michael and Elizabeth Marcus, Charles W. Millard III, and\
  \ Scott Nathan and Laura DeBonis."
