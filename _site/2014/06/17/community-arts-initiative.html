    Community Arts Initiative Artist Project features the works of children from our
    eight partner community organizations working under the guidance of artist Jake
    Fried. The students created multiple stop-motion animations about familiar places
    and people using drawing, flip-books, claymation, and paper cutouts. Each animation
    project stemmed from an exploration of the MFA''s collection and allowed each
    clubhouse to reflect on and represent the people and places important to their
    communities. Students were introduced to new and unique art-making materials and
    skills, while also learning about the Museum''s collection and the wider world
    of video art. The project created a fun and interactive environment where the
    participating students learned, experimented, and bonded with their peers, families,
    and communities.The animated films (looping on monitors) and the artwork made
    to create them (drawings, flip-books, clay sculptures, paper cutouts) are displayed
    in the final Museum exhibition.The exhibition includes the work of approximately
    100 children representing the five Boston Boys & Girls Clubs, West End House Boys
    & Girls Club of Allston-Brighton, Boston Chinatown Neighborhood Center, and United
    South End Settlements.Above: Artwork created by Azeb Fikru from United South End
