    working in Europe during the period between the two World Wars made some of the
    most memorable images in the mediums history. Their goal was to infuse their medium
    with a fresh and distinctly modern style. Influenced by Cubism, Constructivism,
    Dadaism, and Surrealism, and reflecting the effects that technology, urbanization,
    and cinema were having on their time, European photographers adopted unconventional
    and innovative approaches to their image making. Characteristics of their visions
    include rigorous objectivity, surprising camera angles, and darkroom experimentation.
    Photo Eye: Avant-Garde Photography in Europe charts this shift through the work
    of artists such as Constantin Brancusi, Ilse Bing, Andr Kertsz, Man Ray, Lszl
    Moholy-Nagy, and Josef Sudek. Their contributions and those of their peers were
    central to a transformation in photographic expression in the 20th century. The
    exhibition includes a number of important new acquisitions, along with select
    loans.Above: Ilse Bing, Can Can Dancers (detail), 1931. Photograph, gelatin silver
