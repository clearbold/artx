    To Be Global/Prcticas Globales debuts in New England 60 contemporary Latin American
    works from the collection of Ella Fontanals-Cisneros, founder of the CIFO Art
    Foundation in Miami. Featuring sculpture, painting, photography, video, installation,
    and performance art from 1960 to the present, the exhibition explores how avant-garde
    artists from the Caribbean and Central and South America have become integral
    to discourses on international contemporary art after years of exclusion from
    institutions at home and abroad. Four thematic sectionsPower Parodied, Borders
    Redefined, Occupied Geometries, and Absence Accumulatedconsider distinct aesthetic
    strategies that resonate within the artists cultural contexts and beyond. Their
    unique visual languages subvert status quo, defy boundaries, humanize art''s abstractions,
    and revisit forgotten histories. Together they offer critical understandings of
    what it means to be global today. Developed in collaboration with CIFO, the exhibition
    will be shown in both Boston and Miami (opens December 4, 2013, for Art Basel
    Miami Beach) with specially commissioned performances and related installations
    by internationally acclaimed artists.Learn more in the fully illustrated exhibition
