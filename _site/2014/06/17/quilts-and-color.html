    and Color celebrates the vibrant color palette and inventive design seen in the
    acclaimed Pilgrim/Roy Quilt Collection. The exhibition features nearly 60 distinctive
    quilts from the renowned collection and is the first to explore how, over five
    decades, trained artists Paul Pilgrim and Gerald Roy searched out and collected
    quilts with bold, eye-popping designs that echoed the work of mid-20th century
    Abstract Expressionist and Op Artists.The exhibition opens with the vividly colored
    quilts that first drew the collectors attention and began their life-long passion.
    Exploring sophisticated principles of color theory, the exhibitions opening sections
    display color vibrations, mixtures, gradations, and harmonies in the design of
    the quilts ranging from the 19th to early 20th century. As their collection grew,
    Pilgrim and Roy turned their interest to the history of quilting and added more
    traditional designs. Many of these incorporated the color white to create high
    contrast. The exhibitions sectionsVariations and Optical Illusionsexamine the
    effect of color and pattern, highlighting dramatic color choices and innovative
    effects created within established quilt patterns. The exhibition concludes with
    a final nod to the artistic vision of quilt makers and highlights artists who
    worked outside of standard patterns and design.Above: Double Wedding Ring Quilt,
