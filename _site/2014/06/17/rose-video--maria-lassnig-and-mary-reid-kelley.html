    courtesy the artist and fredericks and freiser, new york.In works that draw upon
    illustration, literature, poetry, and performance as much as film and video technologies,
    Maria Lassnig (b.1919) and Mary Reid Kelley (b. 1979) destabilize and revise master
    narratives of art and history with humor and sly wit. The third iteration of Rose
    Video draws a link between Lassnigs animation-based films of the early 1970s and
    the contemporary videos of Reid Kelley, who writes and performs lyrical, pun-filled
    ballads against a backdrop of black and white drawings. The joint presentation
    of their work charts a historical trajectory shaped both by a careful attention
    to craft as well as feminist critique. Lassnig and Reid Kelley build platforms
    for rethinking the roles held and voices raised by women, ultimately suggesting
    the power of the artist to rewrite and remake the stories we inherit.

    Rose Video 03 will open on March 26, with an opening reception and artist talk
