    Fernndez: The Barefoot Designer: A Passion for Radical Design and Community will
    explore the traditions and techniques of indigenous Mexican artisans and how they
    can be applied to modern fashion and styles.Carla Fernndez has gained international
    recognition for her  extraordinary approach to documenting and preserving the
    rich textile heritage of Mexico''s indigenous communities by  transforming it
    into beautiful contemporary clothing, and proving tradition is anything but static.This
    first-ever fashion exhibition at the Gardner Museum explores the development of
    a new language in visual design that Fernndez has built over two decades. She
    uses a method called "the Square Root" based on  the Mexican tradition of making
    clothing from squares and rectangles. This process emphasizes forms of fabric  and
    delicate, thoughtful construction based on whole fabric, as opposed to cutting
    in curves and molding to  the body.The Barefoot Designer is multi-faceted exhibition
    consisting of garments, textiles, drawings, photographs, performance, video,  workshops
    and source materials demonstrating Fernndez''s multi-layered design process. A
    key component of that process is her design workshop Taller Flora, a mobile laboratory
    that collaborates with Mexico''s indigenous communities, a sustainable business
    model based on close collaboration with and recognition of local knowledge and
    talent. During her  career, Fernndez has worked with many indigenous communities
    throughout Mexico. The exhibition will highlight the styles and techniques of
    five states: Chiapas, Yucatan, Campeche, the State of Mexico and Mexico City.Mobility
    and collaboration can be seen and felt throughout the exhibition: in its installation,
    multiple films and monthly dance  performances, as well as workshops for the public.
    The garments and mannequins are positioned on life-sized, mobile  displays. Fernndez
    has also activated the garments through a live and filmed dance performance by
    dancers Raushan Mitchell  and Silas Reiner, bringing to life the notion of "clothing
    as canvas." The exhibition will include short process videos of weavers, embroiderers,
    and carpenters by photographer and filmmaker Ramiro Chaves, as well as fashion
    films produced by Chaves and Pedro Torres in New York City, Boston and Mexico
    City. A series of fashion photos by photographer Graciela Iturbide will be on
    view. A large workshop table adds a hands-on visitor experience to the exhibition,
    with a variety of workshops scheduled. Fernndez will run a two-day clothing workshop
    as well as workshops with the Gardner''s School and  Community Partnership Programs."I
    want people to understand that you can find happiness many different ways, and
    one way is by creating goods by hand and making things unique to the artist,"
    Fernndez said. "Discovering the process helps people to understand how these different
    worlds work, because you fall in love with the artisan, and then you fall in love
    with the piece. You can create a whole economy  based on the artists, and how
    their work is made."Learn more about Carla Fernandez''s residency at the Gardner
