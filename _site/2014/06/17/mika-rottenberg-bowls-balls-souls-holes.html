    \ BOWLS BALLS SOULS HOLES is Rottenbergs (b. 1976) first solo museum exhibition\
    \ in the United States. Conceived in relation to the Roses expansive Lois Foster\
    \ Gallery, the exhibition offers a selective account of the thematic and formal\
    \ interests that have structured Rottenbergs development to date. In addition\
    \ to Squeeze (2010) and Tsss (2013), the Rose will present Rottenbergs newest\
    \ video installation, Bowls Balls Souls Holes (2014), a major new work commissioned\
    \ and funded in part by the museum. \nRottenberg uses the moving image as a device\
    \ to relate impossibly disparateand often highly eccentriccharacters, places,\
    \ and activities, collapsing the space between them to produce parallel worlds.\
    \ The artists videos and the sculptural environments that contain them re-imagine\
    \ space and time to bring fantastical narratives of production and consumption\
    \ to life, and the resulting installations disorient and transport the viewer\
    \ to a place where weird and wonderful production lines abide by their own hermetic,\
    \ relentless logic. Rich in material eccentricity, marginal subjectivities, and\
    \ narrative absurdity, Mika Rottenberg takes the world we share apart and returns\
    \ it to us in a form that is as strange and foreign as it is deeply felt and resonant.\n\
    The exhibition will be accompanied by a monograph on the artist with essays by\
    \ Christopher Bedford, Julia Bryan-Wilson, and Wayne Koestenbaum.", !!python/unicode 'id': '24',
