    Rydz (b. 1979, Miami) received an MFA from the School of the Museum of Fine Arts,
    Boston, in 2005. Rydz explores America''s coasts, photographing the manufactured
    remnants of modern life that wash up on the shoreline. Plastic''s resilience is
    exactly the quality that makes it valuable to us, but what we use, discard, and
    dump in the sea is useless to marine life. Materials that never decay become a
    permanent part of the oceanic ecosystem. Nature''s attempt to reclaim these cast-offs
    fascinates Rydz, who draws our attention to their transformation on their long
    journey along the global ocean current, and to the larger implications of society''s
    everyday actions. This exhibition is the first to include Rydz''s bold photographs,
    which, combined with her delicate drawings, depict these fragments in surprising
    ways.Prior to receiving the SMFAs prestigious Traveling Scholars Fellowship, Rydzs
    research focused on the Atlantic. The fellowship presented her with the opportunity
    to explore the Pacific and see for herself the nexus of marine debris: Kamilo
    Point, Hawaii. She explains, I walked for days through massive amounts of debris
    and plastic sands feeling like an archaeologist excavating the residues of contemporary
    history.Above: Evelyn Rydz, Postcards from Kamilo (Coral and Bottle Cap), 201314.
