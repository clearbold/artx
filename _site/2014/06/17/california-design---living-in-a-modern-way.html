    than 250 examples of midcentury modern design reveal the distinctive role California
    had in shaping material culture from 1930-1965. Featuring a diverse array of furniture,
    textiles, fashion, industrial and graphic design, ceramics, jewelry, metalwork,
    film and architecture, this exhibition celebrates the innovation and pervasiveness
    of midcentury modern design. The work of legendary designers such as Charles and
    Ray Eames, Richard Neutra, and Greta Magnusson Grossman are explored, as is the
    sociological and geographical context which gave rise to this unprecedented design
    movement. Organized by the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA), this exhibition
    is the first major study of California midcentury modern design.Support provided
