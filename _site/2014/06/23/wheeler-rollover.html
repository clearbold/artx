description: "In their Sculpture Park intervention, 4-Wheeler Rollover, Okay Mountain\
  \ stages a rebellious joy ride that rips through deCordova\u2019s pristine campus\
  \ and terminates in an upturned All-Terrain Vehicle (ATV). The eight-member artist\
  \ collective casts the freewheeling tire treads in tinted concrete, to give permanence\
  \ to the normally ephemeral tracks, and to place the vehicle in dialogue with the\
  \ more traditional sculptures that surround it. By deliberately crashing \u201C\
  lowbrow\u201D thrillcraft culture into the \u201Chighbrow\u201D space of fine art,\
  \ Okay Mountain orchestrates the kind of witty cultural collision for which they\
  \ are known.Based in Austin, TX, the artists of Okay Mountain (Carlos Rosales-Silva,\
  \ Corkey Sinks, Josh Rios, Justin Goldwater, Ryan Hennessee, Nathan Green, Peat\
  \ Duggins, Michael Sieben, Sterling Allen, Tim Brown), have been working collaboratively\
  \ since 2006 when they formed an artist-run alternative gallery. Since then, the\
  \ group has exhibited their installation projects throughout the United States and\
  \ in Mexico City. Their large-scale sculptural projects blend humor with a big Texan\
  \ mentality and aesthetic, are rife with art historical references and laced with\
  \ social critique. With 4-Wheeler Rollover, the art historically savvy artists riff\
  \ off the long and hallowed tradition of Land Art by taking the Sculpture Park\u2014\
  once the manicured lawn of Julian de Cordova\u2014as their canvas, but revisit this\
  \ history through the unexpected language of American consumer culture and recreation.\
  \ The collective carves up the Park with a wink, a nod, and a slight jab at Land\
  \ Artists like Michael Heizer, who excavated huge trenches and choreographed lyrical\
  \ motorcycle track drawings in the desert. Their brand of smart, bawdy interventions\
  \ coyly critique the institutionalization of art and invite us all along for the\
  \ ride.Okay Mountain has exhibited at Freight + Volume, NY; Austin Museum of Art,\
  \ TX; Galeria Enrique Guerrero in Mexico City, Mexico; Paragraph in Kansas City,\
  \ KS; PULSE in Miami,FL; Texas State University in San Marcos, TX; the Creative\
  \ Research Lab in Austin, TX; Prosect 1.5 in New Orleans, LA; the Blaffer Art Museum,\
  \ Houston, TX; and McNay Art Museum, San Antonio, TX. While most of the Okay Mountain\
  \ members are alumni of the University of Texas at Austin, others are graduates\
  \ of the University of California, Los Angeles; the Rhode Island School of Design;\
  \ and the University of Kansas.Images \xA9 Andy Ryan."
