description: "The Gardner Museum recently commissioned Michael Van Valkenburgh to\
  \ design a new four-season garden on the site of what Isabella Gardner called her\
  \ \u201CMonk\u2019s Garden.\u201D The redesigned Monk\u2019s Garden, sited to the\
  \ east of the historic palace, opened in September 2013 as part of the Museum\u2019\
  s expanded campus. CORRESPONDENCE features design process and construction drawings\
  \ of the new garden, as well as communications between the design team and contractors\
  \ responsible for its construction. The exhibition centers on a pair of letters\
  \ between Museum director Anne Hawley and Van Valkenburgh describing their aspirations\
  \ for the new garden at the beginning of the design process. The exhibition also\
  \ presents photographs that illustrate how greatly the garden has changed over the\
  \ years.Van Valkenburgh\u2019s design of the Monk\u2019s Garden interprets the Museum\u2019\
  s meandering gallery layout, and the rich colors and textures of its idiosyncratic\
  \ collection, in a contemporary landscape context. While the garden is accessible\
  \ (weather permitting) from both the original Museum building and Renzo Piano\u2019\
  s new addition, it is not the primary connection between them, freeing it to focus\
  \ instead on cultivating a sense of place. The garden is given its own interior,\
  \ with the aim of provoking extended quiet contemplation rather than hurried passage.The\
  \ original high brick wall of Fenway Court surrounds the garden, and the design\
  \ aims to soften this enclosure through the creation of a small-scale, dreamlike\
  \ woodland. Composed of approximately 60 trees including stewartia, paper bark maple,\
  \ and gray birch, the groves establish a detail-rich palette of colors and textures\
  \ suitable for intimate appreciation. Winding paths, paved in a striking combination\
  \ of black brick and reflective mica schist, meander through the trees. Rather than\
  \ intersecting, the paths playfully meet and diverge, while also gently widening\
  \ in places to create nooks for garden chairs. Please join us in the new garden."
