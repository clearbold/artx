description: 'In the first full-scale examination of Joseph Mallord William Turner''s
  lifelong preoccupation with the sea, this exhibition features iconic works spanning
  the artist''s career from his transformative Academy paintings of the late 1790s
  and early 1800s, to the unfinished, experimental seascapes produced towards the
  end of his life. At turns dramatic, contemplative, beautiful and sublime, the sea''s
  mercurial properties captivated Turner and his contemporaries who repeatedly returned
  to the subject. Iconic Turner masterpieces are exhibited alongside works by other
  major European and American artists, providing a rich artistic context for Turner''s
  groundbreaking vision.Turner & the Sea was produced by the National Maritime  Museum,
  part of Royal Museums Greenwich, London. Supported by an  indemnity from the Federal
  Council on the Arts and the Humanities.Carolyn and Peter S. Lynch and The Lynch
  Foundation, and The Manton Foundation provided generous support.The East India Marine
  Associates of the Peabody Essex Museum also provided support.Media Partners:'
