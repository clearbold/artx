description: "Featuring some 40 works, both past and new, 9 Artists includes a range\
  \ of sculpture, drawing, installation, and video. The exhibition is organized by\
  \ the Walker Art Center and curated by Bartholomew Ryan; Alise Upitis is the organizing\
  \ curator for the List. The exhibition recently closed at the Walker Art Center\
  \ and opens at the List on May 9, 2014.Yael Bartana (b. 1970) is an Israeli artist\
  \ who lives and works in Berlin. A key theme in Bartana\u2019s work is the investigation\
  \ and then intervention in the processes by which communities convene, subjects\
  \ are formed, national mythologies maintained, gendered behaviors enforced. The\
  \ exhibition will feature her dynamic video trilogy, and Europe will be stunned,\
  \ which has received considerable international attention since it debuted at the\
  \ 54th Venice Biennale, where the artist represented the Polish Pavilion. and Europe\
  \ will be stunned tells the story of the rise of the Jewish Renaissance Movement\
  \ in Poland, a quasi-fictional political group that calls for the return to that\
  \ country of 3.3 million Jews. Ultimately, in a European context that has seen a\
  \ resurgence in nationalism in recent years, the group becomes home to all who feel\
  \ that citizenship should be organized around more than national, ethnic, or religious\
  \ identity. Intimately invested in the legacy of modernism, Liam Gillick (b.1964)\
  \ makes sculptures, text-based works, and publications that owe much to a working\
  \ through of the failure of its Utopian promise to design a more egalitarian society.\
  \ The exhibition will present a series of projects from the last 20 years of the\
  \ artist\u2019s production\u2014from graphic vinyl wall texts, to giant Bloody Mary\u2019\
  s, to glitter carpets. What aligns the work is a concern for organization, how communities\
  \ exist and are transformed in an era of ever increasing privatization.Natascha\
  \ Sadr Haghighian abjures biography altogether, for instance she sees the artist\
  \ r\xE9sum\xE9 as a shorthand simplification that rates the individual according\
  \ to past institutional affiliations, or regulates them according to conventional\
  \ markers of identity (age, nationality, and so on). In 2004 she created bioswop.net\
  \ for the free exchange and sharing of r\xE9sum\xE9s and biographies. The exhibition\
  \ will feature key works from the last several years that explore the precariousness\
  \ of work and life today.Dutch artist Renzo Martens (b. 1973), who lives and works\
  \ in Brussels and Kinshasa, is known for his satirical and disturbing video documentaries\
  \ in which he travels to war-torn countries and places himself narcissistically\
  \ at the center of the action, demonstrating how Western spectators consume distant\
  \ trauma. For the List, he will present the work of the Institute for Human Activities,\
  \ an organization he has founded dedicated to the transformation through artist-propelled\
  \ gentrification of a former Unilever plantation 800 miles north of Kinshasa on\
  \ the Congo River. New York-based artist Bjarne Melgaard (Norwegian, b. Australia,\
  \ 1967) has produced a newly commissioned work that dispenses with his usual immersive\
  \ and expressionistic installations in favor of a photographic memoir of his movements\
  \ in the work. Disturbing and illuminating, they capture both the figure of the\
  \ artist in seemingly candid documentation and also many of his works and installations.\
  \ The cinematic quality of the presentation is accompanied by a new video and soundtrack\
  \ developed with New York-based artist Marie Karlberg.Artist N\xE1stio Mosquito\u2019\
  s approach (b. 1981 in Angola, lives and works in Luanda) finds form in his music,\
  \ performances, and videos, and the exhibition will present a range of moving image\
  \ works (including a newly commissioned piece) by one of the artists\u2019 alter\
  \ egos N\xE1stia, a Russian accented prognosticator, who discourses about the world\
  \ with a mixture of crude clich\xE9, insight, and satirical self-help dogma. In\
  \ a recent work, Mosquito declared, \u201CI do represent, if you are willing, the\
  \ army of the individuals.\u201D This statement could serve as a guiding motto for\
  \ every artist included in the exhibition. Their loyalty is to the individual, but\
  \ not the individual who exists in isolation, rather one who acts within a community,\
  \ even if this community has yet to be invented. The exhibition features Mosquito\u2019\
  s new video essay, N\xE1stio Mosquito Answers Ryan Bartholomew produced in association\
  \ with Vic Pereir\xF3 and leading out of the artist\u2019s recent performance at\
  \ the Walker. Since the 1990s, Hito Steyerl (b. 1966) has become one of the leading\
  \ voices among artists who play with conventional formats of the documentary genre,\
  \ borrowing from its reputation for objectivity while acknowledging its ongoing\
  \ history as a means of propaganda and indoctrination. 9 Artists features her latest\
  \ work How not to be seen. A fucking didactic educational .MOV file, which debuted\
  \ at the Venice Biennale. The work continues her long meditation on the nature of\
  \ the image in the digital age. Additionally, the exhibition includes Steyerl\u2019\
  s famous Red Alert (2007), which is composed of three computer monitors with monochromatic\
  \ red glowing fields with which the artist claims to have reached the logical end\
  \ of the documentary genre. The work of artist Danh Vo (Danish, b. 1975, Vietnam,\
  \ lives and works in Basel) can be seen as a philosophy of practice that runs through\
  \ his many projects, exhibitions, and relationships\u2013a keen attention to art-historical\
  \ precedence as well as geopolitics and the implications of living in a world that\
  \ is more imbricated than ever before.\_ People, objects, history, and various identity\
  \ formations all become material in his expanding and accumulating oeuvre, producing\
  \ a profound portrait, not necessarily of himself, but of the complicities and complexities\
  \ of life today. The exhibition will feature a new presentation of Vo\u2019s recent\
  \ Guggenheim Museum/Hugo Boss Prize exhibition, I M U U R 2, based on the personal\
  \ archive of deceased Lower East Side painter (and founder of the Museum of American\
  \ Graffiti) Martin Wong that he developed over many years in collaboration with\
  \ his mother Florence Wong.Each artist has contributed a 16-page artist section\
  \ exploring some aspect of their broad practice in relation to the exhibition, ranging\
  \ from meditations on the Trayvon Martin social media campaign, to manifesto-like\
  \ artist statements, and ghost-written letters between an artist and a dead anti-semitic\
  \ philosopher.\_ The book has been produced in collaboration with other artists,\
  \ writers, and designers, such as Karl Holmqvist, Ph\xF9ng Vo, Galit Eilat, Vic\
  \ Pereir\xF3, Brendan Dugan of An Art Service, Federica Bueti, and others. The contributions\
  \ are accompanied by a 32-page compendium of works, and a text by curator Bartholomew\
  \ Ryan that weaves together their various approaches, placing them in the context\
  \ of broader contemporary art practice. Designed and published by the Walker\u2019\
  s award winning design studio, the catalogue is available through Distributed Art\
  \ Publishers.9 Artists is organized by the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis.\_ Major\
