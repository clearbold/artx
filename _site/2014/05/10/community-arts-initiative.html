description: 'This Community Arts Initiative Artist Project features the works of
  children from our eight partner community organizations working under the guidance
  of artist Jake Fried. The students created multiple stop-motion animations about
  familiar places and people using drawing, flip-books, claymation, and paper cutouts.
  Each animation project stemmed from an exploration of the MFA''s collection and
  allowed each clubhouse to reflect on and represent the people and places important
  to their communities. Students were introduced to new and unique art-making materials
  and skills, while also learning about the Museum''s collection and the wider world
  of video art. The project created a fun and interactive environment where the participating
  students learned, experimented, and bonded with their peers, families, and communities.The
  animated films (looping on monitors) and the artwork made to create them (drawings,
  flip-books, clay sculptures, paper cutouts) are displayed in the final Museum exhibition.The
  exhibition includes the work of approximately 100 children representing the five
  Boston Boys & Girls Clubs, West End House Boys & Girls Club of Allston-Brighton,
  Boston Chinatown Neighborhood Center, and United South End Settlements.Above: Artwork
