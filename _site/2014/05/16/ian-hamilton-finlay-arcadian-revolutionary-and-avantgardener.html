description: "This ambitious survey exhibition of the work of the internationally\
  \ renowned Scottish artist, poet, and garden designer Ian Hamilton Finlay showcases\
  \ over 200 objects including sculptures, prints, and books. The show is the first\
  \ museum exhibition of the artist\u2019s work in the United States since his show\
  \ at the Philadelphia Museum of Art in 1992; the exhibition is also the first of\
  \ the artist\u2019s work in the United States since his death in 2006. In addition\
  \ to filling deCordova\u2019s Linde and Foster Galleries, the exhibition contains\
  \ a number of works installed outdoors in the Sculpture Park.After founding Wild\
  \ Hawthorn Press in 1961 and publishing hundreds of artists\u2019 books, Finlay\
  \ rose to prominence as one of Great Britain\u2019s foremost experimental literary\
  \ artists making concrete poetry, a practice which wed language with sculptural\
  \ form. In 1966, he and his wife Sue Finlay built Little Sparta, a garden in Dunsyre,\
  \ Scotland, which became the site for the ultimate realization of his aesthetic\
  \ program. Finlay treated Little Sparta as a site for engaging with cultural inquiry\
  \ and criticism rather than as a sanctuary or more traditional pastoral setting;\
  \ he literally placed language into the landscape in monumental form, encouraging\
  \ a discourse on the reconciliation between nature and modern society.Finlay freely\
  \ mined human history to source imagery for his work. He believed that most positive\
  \ symbols in Western culture had been drained of their meaning through consumerist\
  \ assimilation and desensitization, and so employed universally powerful symbols\
  \ of violence and authority such as machine guns, tanks, and guillotines in his\
  \ work. Finlay\u2019s merger of beauty, violence, and the sacred spoke to his belief\
  \ in the disintegration of contemporary society\u2019s cultural ideals. When encountered\
  \ in juxtaposition to emblems of nature and classical idealism, Finlay\u2019s epigrams\
  \ provoke contemplation of society\u2019s need for a reclamation of civic and aesthetic\
  \ values.Several works demonstrating Finlay\u2019s signature fusion of classical\
  \ beauty and violence are on view in deCordova\u2019s exhibition. Apollo/Saint Just\
  \ after Bernini (1985-2003) is a suite of bronze sculptures of the youthful Olympian\
  \ deity, each equipped\u2013upon closer inspection\u2013with modern weapons such\
  \ as hand grenades and submachine guns, rather than flutes or harps. Similarly,\
  \ Finlay\u2019s Aphrodite de la Terreur (Aphrodite of the Terror) (1987) is a plaster\
  \ sculpture of the Greek goddess of love, beauty, and sexuality\u2013this time adorned\
  \ with a modest red necklace, a chilling reference to the red string worn around\
  \ the necks of mourning relatives of the beheaded during the French Revolution.Finlay\u2019\
  s work often commands attention through his simple visual and verbal plays on language:\
  \ Wildflower Vase (1985) is an ephemeral bouquet in a classical white vase labeled\
  \ with the text \"Wildflower: A Mean Term between Revolution and Virtue.\" Finlay\u2019\
  s text causes the work\u2019s immediate beauty and representation of nature to become\
  \ a prompt for the contemplation of communal mindfulness. In a comparable gesture,\
  \ Finlay\u2019s Panzer Leader (1976) is a cast tortoise whose shell is embossed\
  \ with the word Panzer, a German word that can be translated as tank, armor, or\
  \ turtle shell. Although Panzer Leader appears to be an unassuming, tank-like reptile\
  \ at first glance, Finlay\u2019s application of language quickly renders it a more\
  \ sinister evocation of the thunderous crush of German tanks during World War II.Finlay\u2019\
  s challenging engagement with landscape and history does not make allowance for\
  \ a passive viewing experience. The artist\u2019s work encourages viewers to question\
  \ the role of the detached consumer and to utilize the tools of awareness that Finlay\
  \ presents in his work in order to consider their responsibility in articulating\
  \ the future of society.Funding for this exhibition has been provided by an anonymous\
  \ donor and Joyce Linde.Ian Hamilton Finlay was born to Scottish parents in the\
  \ Bahamas in 1926, and his family returned to Glasgow when he was a child. Although\
  \ his formal education ended with the outbreak of World War II, Finlay began to\
  \ write short stories and play while working as a shepherd during his early adulthood.\
  \ He rose to prominence as one of Great Britain\u2019s foremost experimental literary\
  \ artists after founding Wild Hawthorn Press in 1961, through which he published\
  \ hundreds of artists\u2019 books. Finlay died in 2006 in Edinburgh, Scotland.Today,\
  \ Finlay is regarded as one of the most influential British artists of the twentieth\
  \ century for his work as sculptor, poet, and landscape designer. Finlay\u2019s\
  \ work has been exhibited internationally, including solo exhibitions at the Philadelphia\
  \ Museum of Art, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Tate Gallery, London, England; and\
  \ the Wadsworth Athenaeum, Hartford, Connecticut. In addition to being collected\
  \ by numerous institutions, his work has also been permanently installed in public\
  \ and private outdoor spaces throughout Europe and North America. Together with\
  \ his wife, Sue Finlay, the artist created Little Sparta, a vast garden at Stonypath\
  \ in Dunsyre, Scotland, which blends landscape, sculpture, and language, and currently\
  \ contains nearly 300 examples of the artist\u2019s work.Lunch and Tour with a Curator:\
