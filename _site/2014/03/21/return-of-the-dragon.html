description: "A native of Kyoto, and known for his unconventional techniques and irreverent\
  \ humor, Sh\u014Dhaku depicts a dragon swooping down through whirls of clouds and\
  \ mist, and swishing its scaly tail in a rhythmic symphony of rich shades of ink\
  \ that extends across the thirty-five-foot-long composition. The exhibition commemorates\
  \ the 55th anniversary of the Kyoto-Boston sister city relationship. When the painting\
  \ first entered the MFA\u2019s collection in 1911, it was mounted in four sections\
  \ on thick paper. In recent years, the work was determined to have originally comprised\
  \ eight paintings on sliding doors (fusuma) that would have been part of a larger\
  \ set adorning the interior of a Buddhist temple hall. In preparation for its inclusion\
  \ in a 2012 exhibition of the MFA\u2019s masterpieces in Japan, the paintings were\
  \ treated by specialists in the Museum\u2019s Asian Conservation Studio. Five years\
  \ ago they began the process by separating and repairing the damaged paintings,\
  \ and preparing custom-made wooden lattice cores with multiple layers of paper on\
  \ each side. The paintings were mounted on these modified fusuma panels and finished\
  \ with an appropriate lacquer wooden trim. The MFA has long been widely recognized\
  \ for its unparalleled collection of works by Sh\u014Dhaku, including these works\
  \ on view along with Dragon and Clouds: Hawk (about 1763) and two hanging scrolls\
  \ by the artist from the late 1770s.Download the Dragons Art Connections card and\
  \ search for objects and images throughout the Museum to discover how different\
  \ cultures viewed dragons, and get ideas for art-making activities. See other Art\
