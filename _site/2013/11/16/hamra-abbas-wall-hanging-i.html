description: "Hamra Abbas\u2019s art installation on the front of the Gardner Museum\
  \ shows the spectacular silk and gold curtain (kiswa) that covers the door of the\
  \ Kaaba in Mecca, Islam\u2019s holiest and most venerated site. The artist was inspired\
  \ by a small plaster cast of this object displayed in her mother\u2019s house in\
  \ Lahore, Pakistan. Creating a version of this quintessential Islamic image for\
  \ her adopted city of Boston, the artist seeks to diffuse the prevailing tension\
  \ between East and West by bringing visitors in contact with the unfamiliar through\
  \ visual art.\"Last summer,\" Abbas says, \"I found this cheap plaster imitation\
  \ of the Kaaba door in my mother's house in Lahore. It was hanging askew with a\
  \ sizable layer of dust, which is not surprising for my mom, where chaos takes another\
  \ meaning all together. However, it made me take notice of similar happenings in\
  \ other places, while visiting friends and family and during my interaction with\
  \ people in public spaces, so eventually I started documenting them. For me these\
  \ small imperfections reveal the human element that co-exists with the seemingly\
  \ monolithic ideals of truth and perfection.\"Abbas is the third artist invited\
  \ to create site-specific work for the Gardner fa\xE7ade. The space is devoted to\
  \ new work by Gardner Museum Artists-in-Residence and changes about every six months.\
  \ Abbas came to the Gardner as an Artist-in-Residence in 2011.Hamra Abbas's residency\
  \ at the Gardner Museum was supported in part by The Andy Warhol Foundation for\
  \ the Visual Arts. The Museum receives operating support from the Massachusetts\
  \ Cultural Council.Image: Clements Photography, 2013."
