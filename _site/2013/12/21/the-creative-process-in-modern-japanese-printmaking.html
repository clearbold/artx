description: "In the 20th century, printmaking in Japan became not just a way of producing\
  \ popular images but a fine art form. No longer constrained by the requirements\
  \ of commercial publishing, artists were able to exploit the color woodblock process\
  \ as far as their imaginations could take them, and to experiment with new Western\
  \ media as well.This exhibition showcases the MFA\u2019s holdings in the area of\
  \ 20th-century Japanese prints, including both shin hanga made by the traditional\
  \ collaborative method and s\u014Dsaku hanga produced by a single artist working\
  \ alone. Prints are shown along with preliminary drawings, woodblocks, artists\u2019\
  \ proofs, and variant versions printed from the same blocks, highlighting the interplay\
  \ of creativity and technique in printmaking.A variety of materials, from Takei\
  \ Takeo\u2019s miniature artist books to large collaborative prints, gives visitors\
  \ an intriguing behind-the-scenes look at the work of modern Japanese print artists.The\
  \ exhibition\u2019s centerpiece is the complete set of the six large prints entitled\
  \ Sailboats (1926) by Yoshida Hiroshi. This iconic work, probably the single best-known\
  \ example of shin hanga, collaborative method, uses the same woodblocks printed\
  \ in six different color schemes to show the boats at different times of day; the\
  \ printing is so skillful that works from this series are sometimes mistaken for\
  \ watercolors.Above: Yoshida Hiroshi, Sailboats: Morning, from the series Inland\
  \ Sea, Taisho era\u2013Showa era, 1926. Woodblock print; ink and color on paper.\
