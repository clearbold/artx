#### Stubbed in Ajax functions

Review [the URL list](https://github.com/clearbold/artx/blob/master/notes/urls.md). All of these should rely on a static JSON file to trigger a response or update in the screen, which will be spec for the backend team.

I would emphasize a sampling of different functions here that we can copy and paste and fill in. I.e., 1 load more function should be a priority, such that we can copy and paste it to other contexts. Let's focus on hitting examples of unique function roles.

- [ ] Adding a favorite - Should the star not fill in until there's a success response from the server?
- [ ] Adding a favorite - Triggering a refresh of the My Favorites bar at the bottom *after* the new favorite has been added
- [ ] Validation on Sign up - Check that email address isn't in use (Display an error based on server response)
- [ ] My Interests - SetInterest - Update based on server response? (Use a static JSON response to trigger checkmark)
- [ ] Settings = SetPreference (Use a static JSON response)
- [ ] Load More on My Favorites, My Interests, By Date, By Location
- [ ] History - Set attendance

#### Other Sign Up Validation

- [ ] Check that passwords match

#### Visual

- [ ] Transition for Map & Calendar list - Fade out/in the list?

#### Tweaks

- [ ] Calendar is off-center on iPhone screen
- [ ] History should be a checkbox with a "Yes" label for "Did you attend?"

#### Low priority

- [ ] Other nice options for toggles that support taps?
- [ ] Chrome / iPhone 5 emulator?
