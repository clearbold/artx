* Review URLs list (https://github.com/clearbold/artx/blob/master/notes/urls.md)
* The question of whether content is discoverable on the calendar & map has been resolved.
* With the map added to the roster of templates (http://staging.artx.clearbold.com/index.html), and knowing that some screens will be different states managed by the backend application, do we think anything is missing from that list?
* Mark to provide Clearbold's take on onboarding, including sign-up & sign-in differences. (The overlay question)
* History page: Open question as to toggle (forces a question) vs. checkbox (implies a preference)
* Settings pages: We rearranged this page so that the submit/save button is grouped with the text fields, and the other toggles can be live via Ajax
* Toggle tweaks: Tap to change, labels/accessiblity, target sizes & physical/pixel sizes
* Back button has been removed from Favorites for consistency. Back buttons and where they're displayed will be managed by the app code. (They should be implemented in cases where parallel browsing, events to events or venues, takes place and where items can't easily be returned to via the nav. I.e., if I click an event from Favorites, do I need a back button? Or do I return to the nav? If I click a related event from another event, I definitely need a back button.)

Outstanding:

* Stub in Ajax functions that change state
* Work on map
* Document onboarding
