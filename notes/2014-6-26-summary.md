#### Design changes

* We've implemented a temporary brand name of ArtsConnect on the main screen.
* We've asserted that immediately responsive navigation elements, things that are functional in-screen, get circle icons. Navigation cues that support screen-to-screen navigation do not.
  * You'll see that the icon to reveal tags, the icon to reveal the nav, and the icon to "star" an event as a favorite all have the circle treatment, because they're all immediate, in-screen functions
  * The arrow icon on "My Favorites" does not have the circle treatment, because it's merely reinforcing that the item is tappable and will navigate to another screen.
  * This should emerge as a consistent visual affordance for the user to anticipate navigation behaviors.
* Tag & app-wide navigation have been implemented for review.
* Additional screens are underway for review & discussion: http://staging.artx.clearbold.com

### Questions we've been working on:

#### "Back" navigation

If we assume app mode ("add to home screen"), then we lose browser-based navigation and must rely on in-app navigation. To reach top-level app screens, the built-in app navigation suffices, but as the user clicks from event to related event to venue, etc, how do they go back a step without a back button?

The paper prototype did have a built-in back button, and we've used that space for the omni-present tags navigation, leaving little room in the outer UI for a permanent back button. A back button is also not a consistent, permanent destination, and I struggle a bit with it being in the primary navigation UI. A "back to ____" link would work within the content area, but it would need to be aware of the previously viewed entity. And if a browser emerges as the primary means of viewing the app, this becomes redundant to its back button. (Or swiping to go back.)

First we need to identify a primary use case and work to address that. Though we should consider that we can never rule out a user adding this app to their home screen.

One other note: navigating between events, exhibitions, venues based on recommended links is parallel navigation, not hierarchical, so this is not a breadcrumbs solution. Breadcrumbs would allow you to quickly go up a level to the parent, but we're describing is a 1...n trail of clicks across various events, exhibitions, etc.

#### Sign-up & Onboarding

We've included a version of the homepage with the sign-up screen enabled.

Our assumption is that this would be triggered absent a cookie, set by the app, saying that you're signed in.

It contains a sign in link (for users who have already signed up but are not logged in) that will link to a full sign-in screen within the app. That sign-in screen will also contain a "not signed up?" link that will trigger the sign up overlay on that page.

"Sign In" is also an option in the primary nav, linking to that full sign-in screen. For logged-in users, that link should change to "Log Out" or "Sign Out".

We're assuming that some JavaScript-based validation on password requirements in the sign up form will be supported, and we should support an AJAX post to the server to check if an email address is in use, as a means of validation. Both of those should respond with inline error handling.

If the entered data is valid, we assume the sign up overlay form will submit directly to a server-side URL, which will process the sign up and redirect the user to the prompt to start selecting tags. This is not in place yet. I.e., once you submit the form, you navigate away from the home screen and the overlay, get processed in server-side app logic, and redirected to the initial tag selection screen. Once you complete tag selection, you'll be returned to the home screen.

Finally, there are two content states for "My Favorites" sans selected favorites. In the version of the homepage we've posted, if you hit the X to close out of the sign up overlay, you see text telling you that favorites are supported if you sign up. There will need to be alternate copy for the newly signed-up user who doesn't yet have any favorites, and the backend app will need to manage those two states. This brings up another question...

#### Interacting with Favorites

If I'm a new user, and I have no favorites, and I star an item on the homescreen, do I have to wait to refresh or revisit the page to see that in My Favorites below, or should that happen in real-time?
