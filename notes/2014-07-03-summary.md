* The "Tags" navigation icon has been removed from the header.
* On non-Home screens that support parallel browsing, that slot now has a Back button, which navigates back through the browser history.

* Tags are now "My Interests" and are available in the nav.
* The My Interests screen supports intro copy at the top and checkmark status indicators for your selections.

* My Favorites has been removed from the bottom of the Favorites screen.

* The Settings screen has been started, with email & password fields as well as "switch" fields for various settings.

* The History screen has been started, supporting intro copy and "switch" fields for attendance.

* Most screens, in fact, now support intro copy. That can be omitted without compromising a given screen's design.

* The Favorites, My Interests and History screens are available in the nav to non-logged-in users to "tease" their interest, implying that intro copy would change and be conditional based on authentication status. ("Log in to access your Favorites or sign up to create an account.")

* Settings is hidden for non-logged-in users.

* The Sign In screen is now in place.

Next week we'll continue to focus on onboarding/sign-up/sign-in user flow, incorporate any feedback and continue working on the breadth of the baseline screens. Following that, we'll start to pull in our Jekyll-based event & location data to fill in screens and and move into the more complex JavaScript work on the map and calendar. Future updates will also include stubbed-in Ajax calls in conjunction with any functions that toggle state (favorites, interests, etc).
