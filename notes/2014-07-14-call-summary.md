Jamie:
Discover = recommendation engine
Maps & Events = unfiltered

Desi & Liam need to weigh in, not a one-stop shop

Load more can help weight results to top ten

If top results are weighted, but others are available, users can explore the universe.

Favorites back button based on source/context - 
Back button appears any time you're viewing an Event or Venue, but nowhere directly through navigation
"Infinite possible path"
Document rationale <- We'll document our take. Button can be enabled/disabled on any screen via backend app code

Follow up on Desi's Yes/No toggle comment
iPhone requires a swipe - Too rigid - More options?

Revisit some of the toggles to make them easier? (Tap targets)

Settings screen: Bundle text fields with Submit button, use Ajax for toggles with one function

History: Put the user on the spot to make a commitment and answer a question, which may better prompt a response. (Yes/No buttons vs checkboxes)

Overlay is part of the onboarding process to tease & entice, grab you on first visit. We'll document our assumptions around onboarding.


***

Favorites has back button but not History—seems inconsistent
Toggle yes/no function
Could users tap to change toggle? 
Yes/no text on toggle seems redundant
Toggle could be smaller/less wide
On Settings page: Submit button is strange—what are you submitting? Notifications or password/email combo? Kurt and I feel like you shouldn't have to submit notification changes 
On History page: "Attended" shouldn't be toggle control—seems strange. check box?
Sign In page: Could it be an overlay? Why is "Sign Up" overlay but not "Sign In"?
