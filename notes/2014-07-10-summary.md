#### Questions & Notes

* Are events recommended/suggested anywhere other than the Discover screen? (Are there other screens to design?)
* Are Location & Calendar event listings unfiltered/unbiased? Was the intent that these also be filtered by the recommendation engine?
  * This ends up being a bigger question for us. Are these views limited to events relevant to me? Or are they unfiltered? I (MR) am of the opinion that a user should be able to see all events in the database somewhere within the app, and that these views are good candidates for that. They may skip over "My Interests" or not be diligent. They may need a way to start browsing events and then Favoriting them to help feed the engine. (Does the engine factor in Favorites, too?)
  * One thing I like to keep in mind is that it puts us in a precarious position to assume the user will utilize the app eplicitly how we envision it. That our job is to observe emergent behavior and adapt. I'm wary of assuming we can provide meaningful content to users purely on their self-selection of interests without more organic discover.
* We created a list of JSON & HTML URLs we're anticipating: https://github.com/clearbold/artx/blob/master/notes/urls.md
