* Tags will live on their own screen, where the user will be informed as to their usage and can select/deselect tags representing their interest.
  * That screen will be accessed via the nav.
  * It will also hijack their sign-up process for initial tag selection.
* We'll refer to tags as "Interests," as in "My Interests."
* We'll relinquish the tag icon's space in the primary nav bar while we continue to evaluate how "back navigation" can take that slot.
* We'll include refreshing Favorites right away in the Favorites bar.
* We'll revisit the swipe speed and number of elements in the Favorites bar.
* We'll remove the Favorites bar from the My Favorites screen.
